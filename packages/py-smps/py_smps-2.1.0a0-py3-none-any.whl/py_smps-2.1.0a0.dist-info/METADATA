# py-smps
Python library for the analysis and visualization of data from a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS) and other particle sizing instruments (SEMS, OPC's).

## Dependencies

The full list of dependencies can be found in the `pyproject.toml` file and are summarized below:

```py
python = ">=3.8, <3.12"
statsmodels = "^0.13"
seaborn = "^0.10"
joblib = "^1.0"
requests = "^2.24"
scipy = "^1.9"
numpy = "^1.23.2"
pandas = "^1.4"
```

As of `v1.2.0a0`, the library should be compatible with Apple silicone (tested on both M1 and M2).

## Python Versions

Python3.8 through Python3.11 are currently supported.

## Installation

To install from PyPi:

    $ pip install py-smps [--upgrade]

If you'd like the latest pre-release:

    $ pip install py-smps --pre [--upgrade]

To install the edge release directly from GitHub:

    pip install git+https://github.com/quant-aq/py-smps.git

## Unittests

Unittests can be run by issuing the following command from within the main repo:

```sh
$ poetry run pytest -s tests/ --ignore=tests/datafiles
```


## Documentation
