```
### create a virtualenv for development

$ make virtualenv

$ source env/bin/activate


### run wi cli application

$ wi --help


### run pytest / coverage

```


### Releasing to PyPi

Before releasing to PyPi, you must configure your login credentials:

**~/.pypirc**:

```

```

Then use the included helper function via the `Makefile`:

```
$ make dist

$ make dist-upload
```

## Deployments
