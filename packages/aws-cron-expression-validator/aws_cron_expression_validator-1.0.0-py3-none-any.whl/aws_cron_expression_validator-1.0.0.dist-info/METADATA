# AWSCronExpressionValidator

Validates these [AWS EventBridge cron expressions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-create-rule-schedule.html#eb-cron-expressions), which are similar to, but not compatible with Unix style cron expressions;

| Field        | Values          | Wildcards     |
| :----------: | :-------------: | :-----------: |
| Minute       | 0-59            | , - * /       |
| Hour         | 0-23            | , - * /       |
| Day-of-month | 1-31            | , - * ? / L W |
| Month        | 1-12 or JAN-DEC | , - * /       |
| Day-of-week  |  1-7 or SUN-SAT | , - * ? L #   |
| Year         | 1970-2199       | , - * /       |
