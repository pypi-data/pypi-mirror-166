## Get Started

For local development of `nevermined-contracts` you can either use Docker, or setup the development environment on your machine.

### Docker

The simplest way to get started with is using the [Nevermined Tools](https://github.com/nevermined-io/tools),
a docker compose application to run all the Nevermined stack.

### Public Network development

For deploying in a public network check [ReleaseProcess.md](./docs/ReleaseProcess.md) first.

### Local development

As a pre-requisite, you need:

* Node.js
* yarn

Clone the project and install all dependencies:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:nevermined-io/contracts.git
cd nevermined-contracts/
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

Compile the solidity contracts:

```bash
yarn compile
```

In a new terminal, launch an Ethereum RPC client, e.g. hardhat:

```bash
npx hardhat node --port 18545
```

Switch back to your other terminal and deploy the contracts:

```bash
yarn deploy:external
```

For redeployment run this instead

```bash
yarn clean
yarn compile
yarn deploy:external
```

Upgrade contracts [**optional**]:

```bash
yarn upgrade:external
```

## Testing

Run tests with `yarn test`, e.g.:

```bash
yarn test test/unit/agreements/AgreementStoreManager.Test.js
```

### Code Linting

Linting is setup for `JavaScript` with [ESLint](https://eslint.org) & Solidity with [Ethlint](https://github.com/duaraghav8/Ethlint).

Code style is enforced through the CI test process, builds will fail if there're any linting errors.

```bash
yarn lint
```

## Networks

When Nevermined contracts are deployed into different networks, the ABIs referring to the specific
version deployed are copied into the [Artifacts repository](https://artifacts.nevermined.rocks/).
You can find more information about the this into the [Release Process documentation](docs/ReleaseProcess.md).

You can browse the different artifacts deployed here: http://artifacts-nevermined-rocks.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/
Also you can find a complete list here: https://artifacts.nevermined.rocks/


## Packages

To facilitate the integration of `nevermined-contracts` there are `Python`, `JavaScript` packages ready to be integrated. Those libraries include the Smart Contract ABI's.
Using these packages helps to avoid compiling the Smart Contracts and copying the ABI's manually to your project. In that way the integration is cleaner and easier.
The packages provided currently are:

* JavaScript `NPM` package - As part of the [@nevermined-io npm organization](https://www.npmjs.com/settings/nevermined-io/packages),
  the [npm nevermined-contracts package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nevermined-io/contracts) provides the ABI's
  to be imported from your `JavaScript` code.
* Python `Pypi` package - The [Pypi nevermined-contracts package](https://pypi.org/project/nevermined-contracts/) provides
  the same ABI's to be used from `Python`.

The packages contains all the content from the `doc/` and `artifacts/` folders.

In `JavaScript` they can be used like this:

Install the `nevermined-contracts` `npm` package.

```bash
npm install @nevermined-io/contracts
```

Load the ABI of the `NeverminedToken` contract on the `Rinkeby` network:

```javascript
const NeverminedToken = require('@nevermined-io/contracts/artifacts/NeverminedToken.rinkeby.json')
```

The structure of the `artifacts` is:

```json
{
  "abi": "...",
  "bytecode": "0x60806040523...",
  "address": "0x45DE141F8Efc355F1451a102FB6225F1EDd2921d",
  "version": "v0.9.1"
}
```

## Documentation

## Prior Art

This project builds on top of the work done in open source projects:

* [zeppelinos/zos](https://github.com/zeppelinos/zos)
* [OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-eth](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-eth)
