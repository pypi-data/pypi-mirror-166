# CookieDB CLI

CookieDB CLI is a way to access CookieDB interactively, without having to **write files**, and can perform all the actions available in the [CookieDB](https://github.com/jaedsonpys/cookiedb) library.

Install `cookiedb-cli` using pip:

```
pip install cookiedb-cli
```

## Using CookieDB-CLI

To use the `CLI` version, you need to know the [CookieDB library](https://github.com/jaedsonpys/cookiedb). After that, just use the same methods.

Some standard CLI commands are:

- `exit`: Closes the command interface;
- `list`: List all databases;
- `db`: The CookieDB class instance.

A password will always be **required to access** the available databases.
