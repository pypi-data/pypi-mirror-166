## Overview
[mosra/m.css] is a Doxygen-based documentation generator that significantly improves on Doxygen's default output
by controlling some of Doxygen's more unruly options, supplying it's own slick HTML+CSS generation and adding
a fantastic live search feature. **Poxy** builds upon both by:
- Moving the configuration out into a TOML file
- Preprocessing the Doxygen XML to fix a bunch of Doxygen _~~bugs~~_ quirks
- Postprocessing the generated HTML to improve syntax highlighting and add a few other improvements
- Allowing source, image and example directories to be recursive or shallow on a per-directory basis
- Automatically defining C++ language feature macros based on your project's target C++ version
- Automatically integrating the cppreference.com doxygen tagfile
- Providing a number of additional built-in doxygen `@alias` commands
- Giving more control over the HTML inline using square-bracket `[tags][/tags]`
- Quite a bit more!

## Example
The homepage + documentation for [toml++] is built using poxy:
- homepage: [marzer.github.io/tomlplusplus](https://marzer.github.io/tomlplusplus/)
- config file: [`poxy.toml`](https://github.com/marzer/tomlplusplus/blob/master/docs/poxy.toml)

<br><br>

## Installation
### Prerequisites:
- Python 3
- Doxygen (preferably a version from this decade, though most will be OK)
### Then:
```sh
pip install poxy
```

<br><br>

## Usage
Poxy is a command-line application.
```
poxy [-h] [-v] [--doxygen <path>] [--dry] [--m.css <path>] [--threads N] [--version] [--werror] [--xmlonly]
            [--ppinclude <regex>] [--ppexclude <regex>] [--nocleanup] [--theme {auto,light,dark,custom}]
            [config]

Generate fancy C++ documentation.

positional arguments:
  config                path to poxy.toml or a directory containing it (default: .)

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose         enable very noisy diagnostic output
  --doxygen <path>      specify the Doxygen executable to use (default: find on system path)
  --dry                 do a 'dry run' only, stopping after emitting the effective Doxyfile
  --m.css <path>        specify the version of m.css to use (default: uses the bundled one)
  --threads N           set the number of threads to use (default: automatic)
  --version             print the version and exit
  --werror              always treat warnings as errors regardless of config file settings
  --xmlonly             stop after generating and preprocessing the Doxygen xml
  --ppinclude <regex>   pattern matching HTML file names to post-process (default: all)
  --ppexclude <regex>   pattern matching HTML file names to exclude from post-processing (default: none)
  --nocleanup           does not clean up after itself, leaving the XML and other temp files intact
  --theme {auto,light,dark,custom}
                        the CSS theme to use (default: auto)
```
The basic three-step to using Poxy is similar to Doxygen:
1. Create your `poxy.toml` (Poxy's answer to the `Doxyfile`)
2. Invoke Poxy on it: `poxy path/to/poxy.toml` (or simply `poxy` if the cwd contains the config file)
3. See your HTML documentation `<cwd>/html`

ℹ&#xFE0F; If there exists a `Doxyfile` or `Doxyfile-mcss` in the same directory as your `poxy.toml` it will be loaded
first, then the Poxy overrides applied on top of it. Otherwise a 'default' Doxyfile is used as the base.

<br><br>

## Config file options

For a self-contained `poxy.toml` example to copy and paste from, see [the one used by toml++](https://github.com/marzer/tomlplusplus/blob/master/docs/poxy.toml).

For a full list of options, with full descriptions, schemas and usage examples, see the [Configuration options] wiki page.

## Migrating from Doxygen
Generally the relevant `Doxyfile` options will have a corresponding `poxy.toml` option
(or be replaced by something more specific) so migration is largely a transcription and box-ticking exercise,
though there are a few gotchas:

#### **⚠&#xFE0F; The majority of Doxygen's options are controlled by Poxy**
Very few of the configurable options from the Doxyfile remain untouched by Poxy. This is intentional;
[m.css] is opinionated, and Poxy even moreso. There are a few instances where information can flow from a Doxyfile to
Poxy, but these situations are few, and all are documented explicitly on the [Configuration options] wiki page.

#### **⚠&#xFE0F; All relative input paths are relative to the config file, _not_ CWD**
This is in contrast to Doxygen, which has all paths be relative to the Doxygen process' current working directory
regardless of where the Doxyfile was. I've always personally found that to be nothing but a source of error,
so Poxy does away with it.

#### **⚠&#xFE0F; Output is always emitted to CWD**
Poxy always emits the output html to `<cwd>/html`. This is largely to simplify the HTML post-process step.

#### **⚠&#xFE0F; Poxy config files are self-contained**
There is no equivalent to Doxygen's `@INCLUDE`. If your project is structured in such a way that an N-levels-deep
Doxyfile hierarchy is necessary, Poxy isn't for you.

## Why the name "Poxy"?

Originally it was simply called "dox", but there's already a C++ documentation project with that name, so I smashed
"python" and "dox" together and this is what I came up with.

Also "poxy" can be slang for cheap, inferior, poor quality, etc., which I thought was funny.
