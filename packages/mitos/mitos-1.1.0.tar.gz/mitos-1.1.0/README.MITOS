standalone
==========

adapt src/CONFIG.py
- set MTDB to the path where this file is located 
  SRCPATH, DATAPATH, MITFI*,MITOSPATH should be automatically correct
- ANALYSEPATH and BACKUPPATH can be ignored
- the WEBSERVER, QUEUEING, DB parts of the config can be ignored
  for the standalone version
- in the part "external tools" you need to configure VIENNAPATH and 
  INFERNALPATH these should be set to the paths where the Vienna RNA 
  package (version 1.8.x) and the infernal (version 1.0.2) binaries 
  can be found
- the part "logging defaults" can also be ignored

Further prerequisites: 
- blastall has to be in the PATH
- Rscript has to be in the PATH and ggplot2 has to be installed in R
- python (tested is 2.7)
- biopython must be available 
- R with installed ggplot2

MITOS can be started with 
python ~/src/mitos.py 
the parameter -h shows the options. 
The options -i, -c, and -o are mandatory. 

client and server
=================

adapt CONFIG.py
- all variable starting QUEUE... 

server
======

- copy mtdb/web/mitos/ to web server directory
- set .htaccess PythonPath to mtdb/src 
- httpd.conf 
  * AlloweOverride All or
  * AddHandler mod_python .py .. nach httpd.conf
- set and create WRKPATH and TOMCATPATH
  * WRKPATH must be writable by the apache user and the user executing
    mitoscs.pt server
  * TOMCATPATH must be writable by the user running mitoscs.py and 
    accessible to apache (ie below public_html)
  * the directories can be the same! Easiest is to create it with permission 
    777
- set EMAILSERVER
- set WEBPATH to the full URL of MITOS that is accessible from outside 
- ln -s mitos/example/ mitos-output/example

client
====== 

Adoptions of the CONFIG file 
- set WRKPATH and create it
Further:
- for genome output some fonts are necessary for reportlab (which should have been 
  installed automatically with biopython), see:  http://john.parnefjord.se/node/51

webserver
=========

- verzeichniss /var/www/mitos & /var/www/mitos/mitos-output anlegen
  + schreibbar fuer www-data
- WRKPATH TOMCATPATH auf /var/www/mitos/mitos-output setzen
- WEBPATH anpassen 
- EMAILSERVER anpassen
- MITOS_TRACKING_CODE anpassen

- cp -r web/mitos/ /var/www/ (takes care that .htaccess is copied)
- set src/ directory in first line of .htaccess
