# Open LISA SDK

This SDK provides an interface to interact with the [Open LISA Server](https://github.com/aalvarezwindey/Open-LISA-Server). The server must be integrated with the instruments of interest and running in a known IP and port (TCP connections) or you must known the serial port (SERIAL connections) for the client side in order to be able to connect via this SDK.

## Installation

```
pip install open-lisa-sdk
```

## Examples

You can check online [examples](https://github.com/aalvarezwindey/Open-LISA-SDK/tree/main/examples). You can go to examples folder and run

```bash
python <example_script_name>.py
```

## API Doc

`SDK(log_level='WARNING', default_response_format='PYTHON')`: Initializes the SDK with the specified log level and default response format of the methods

    Args:
        log_level (str, optional): specifies the SDK log level. Defaults to "WARNING".
        default_response_format (str, optional): specifies the response format of the SDK methods supported
        types are "PYTHON" for Python native types or "JSON" for JSON strings. Defaults to "PYTHON".

### Methods

`connect_through_RS232(self, baudrate=921600, port=None) ‑> None`: Tries to connect with Open LISA Server through RS232 protocol
