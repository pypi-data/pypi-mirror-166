## Typing stubs for tree-sitter

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `tree-sitter` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `tree-sitter`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/tree-sitter. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `b98ee679fb070a9fc0351181b76ca64c422ad29f`.
