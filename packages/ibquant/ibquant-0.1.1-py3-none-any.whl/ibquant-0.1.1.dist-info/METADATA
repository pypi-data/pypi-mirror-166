# IB Quant

A command line interface and Python framework for the Interactive Brokers APIs.


## Overview

IB Quant leverages [ib-insync](https://github.com/erdewit/ib_insync) to interface with Interactive Brokers TWS or Gateway.

The CLI is named `ib`.

After installing ibquant, ib's command groups can be shown in terminal with:

```sh
ib --help
```

For now, the CLI mostly serves to replace pytest as qualifying tests that a function or method is working as intended before including in a script. Most CLI commands replicate tasks that can be easily accomplished in the TWS platform.

The end goal is that these CLI commands come together in a high level command such as `ib trader run --strategy=some_strategy_name.py` to have core.Trader run the given strategy and perform appropriate pre, intra, and post trade reporting (logging) requirements, if any.

## Core Classes and Mixin Interfaces

`core.AppBase` serves as a base for all other core classes

`core.Trader` drives a user defined strategy in live trading

`core.Brute` enables brute force optimization of rules based trading strategies

`core.Learner` is used to optimize gradient based learning strategies

`mixins.AccountMixins` enables account features for non-advisor accounts

`mixins.AdvisorMixins` enables features for an advisor account (groups, model portfolios)

`mixins.ConnectionMixins` handles the connection to the running TWS or Gateway sesion

`mixins.ContractMixins` provides an extended class to define [contracts](https://interactivebrokers.github.io/tws-api/contracts.html) for the TWS API

`mixins.DataMixins` provides utilities for fetching historical data, and for streaming top of book or limit order book data.

`mixins.OrderMixins` provides interfaces for several TWS [order types](https://interactivebrokers.github.io/tws-api/available_orders.html)

`mixins.StrategyMixins` provides a base class for user defined strategies

> core.Learner should be used with my ML template, [lightning-pod](https://github.com/JustinGoheen/lightning-pod)

## Installation

The package can be installed for standard use or for development.

Required dependencies for standard use as a package are shown in [setup.cfg](setup.cfg) under `install_requires` of the `options` group.

Dev dependencies are shown in [setup.cfg](setup.cfg) under the `options.extras_require` group.

### Installing the package for standard use
ibquant is available via PyPi with pip. Installation can be done with:

_conda_
```sh
conda env create -n ibquant python -y
conda activate ibquant
pip install ibquant
```

_venv_
```sh
cd {{ path to your project }}
python3 -m venv .venv/
# Activate the environment
# Linux and MacOS
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
# install the package
pip install ibquant
```


### Installing the package for development
After cloning the repo, the framework can be installed for development with:

```sh
# creating a virtual environment
cd {{ path to ibquant clone }}
python3 -m venv .venv/
# Activate the environment
# Linux and MacOS
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
# install an editable version of the package
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Usage

After installing ibquant, log into a TWS paper account and test example flows from terminal with:

```sh
ib advisor managed-accounts
```

```sh
ib account summary
```

```sh
ib contract lookup --contract-type=Future
```

Each of the above commands will prompt the user for required inputs.

> localSymbol, multiplier, and currency prompts of  `ib contract lookup` are not required

## Ecosystem

Aside from using ib-insync, ibtrader also provides users with:

- [QuantLib](https://quantlib-python-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [alphalens-reloaded](https://alphalens.ml4trading.io/): community maintained version of Quantopian alphalens
- [empyrical-reloaded](https://empyrical.ml4trading.io/): community maintained version of Quantopian empyrical
- [pyfolio-reloaded](https://pyfolio.ml4trading.io/): community maintained version of Quantopian pyfolio
- [zipline-reloaded](https://zipline.ml4trading.io/): community maintained version of Quantopian zipline
- [nasdaq-data-link](https://docs.data.nasdaq.com/docs/python-installation): formerly known as Quandl
- [PyEX](https://pyex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): an IEX Cloud API tool
- [TA-Lib](http://mrjbq7.github.io/ta-lib/): a technical analysis library common to PyEX and Zipline

## Factors, Indicators, Studies, Strategies

Zipline Reloaded provides factors and indicators in the [pipeline API](https://zipline.ml4trading.io/api-reference.html#pipeline-api). TA-Lib is installed as a dependency of Zipline. Most factors and indicators of both libraries will be reachable via ibtrader.factors.

Indicator definitions can be found at:

### Python

As with the above, the books shown below are considered standard suggestions.

- [Fluent Python](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Fluent_Python/H1SXzQEACAAJ?hl=en) (Ramalho)
- [High Performance Python](https://www.google.com/books/edition/High_Performance_Python/GMyzyQEACAAJ?hl=en) (Gorelick et al)
- [Python for Data Analysis](https://wesmckinney.com/book/) (McKinney)

Aside from the texts, and possibly a more suitable way to learn professional level Python programming, is to look at the source code of the Quantopian reloaded projects.
