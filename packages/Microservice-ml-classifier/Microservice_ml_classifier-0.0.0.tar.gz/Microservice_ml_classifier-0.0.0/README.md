# Microservice ml classifier

This repository is my attempt to play with areas that are sometimes omitted in machine
learning projects. Some of them are:

- Packaging the machine learning model
- Implement a CI/CD pipeline to ensure code works as expected
- Deployment to a production environment
- Build an API to create an interface between the client and the server
- Explore different architectures based on project needs: Docker, IaaS, PaaS...

These areas are very often managed by other roles in software teams such as DevOps,
Architects or Backend software engineers. On the other hand, a Machine Learning Engineer, 
is usually in charge of building training and inference pipelines for models in a development
environment.

I want to enrich my craft and experience working in these areas.

Hope it helps to anyone who reads this!
