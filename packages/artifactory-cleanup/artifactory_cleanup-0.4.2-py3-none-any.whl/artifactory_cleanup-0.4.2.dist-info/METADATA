# Installation
Upgrade/install to the newest available version:
```bash
python3 -mpip install artifactory-cleanup

# Directly from git
python3 -mpip install git+https://github.com/devopshq/artifactory-cleanup.git

# To be able to change files

cd artifactory-cleanup
python3 -mpip install -e .
```

# Usage

Suppose you want to remove all artifacts older than N days from 'reponame'.
You should take the following steps:

1. Install `artifactory-cleanup`
2. Ð¡reate a python file, for example, `reponame.py` with the following contents:

```python
from artifactory_cleanup import rules
from artifactory_cleanup import CleanupPolicy

RULES = [

  # ------ ALL REPOS --------
  CleanupPolicy(
    'Delete files older than 30 days',
    rules.Repo('reponame'),
    rules.DeleteOlderThan(days=30),
  ),
]
```
3. Run the command to SHOW (not remove) artifacts that will be deleted:
```bash
artifactory-cleanup --user user --password password --artifactory-server https://repo.example.com/artifactory --config reponame.py
```
4. Add `--destroy` flag to REMOVE artifacts
```bash
artifactory-cleanup --destroy --user user --password password --artifactory-server https://repo.example.com/artifactory --config reponame.py
```

## Commands ##

```bash
# Debug
# debug run - only print founded artifacts. it do not delete
artifactory-cleanup --user user --password password --artifactory-server https://repo.example.com/artifactory --config reponame.py

# Debug run only for policytestname. Find any *policytestname*
# debug run - only print founded artifacts. it do not delete
artifactory-cleanup --policy-name policytestname --user user --password password --artifactory-server https://repo.example.com/artifactory --config reponame.py

# REMOVE
# For remove artifacts use --destroy
artifactory-cleanup --destroy --user user --password password --artifactory-server https://repo.example.com/artifactory  --config reponame.py
```

## Available Rules ##

All rules are imported from the `rules` module.
See also [List of available cleaning rules](docs/RULES)

## Artifact cleanup policies ##

To add a cleaning policy you need:

- Create a python file, for example, `reponame.py`. `artifacroty-cleanup` imports the variable `RULES`, so you can make a python package.
- Add a cleanup rule from the [available cleanup rules](docs/RULES).

```python
from artifactory_cleanup import rules
from artifactory_cleanup import CleanupPolicy

RULES = [

  CleanupPolicy(
    'Delete all * .tmp repositories older than 7 days',
    rules.RepoByMask('*. tmp'),
    rules.DeleteOlderThan(days=7),
  ),
  CleanupPolicy(
    'Delete all images older than 30 days from docker-registry exclude latest, release',
    rules.Repo('docker-registry'),
    rules.ExcludeDockerImages(['*:latest', '*:release*']),
    rules.DeleteDockerImagesNotUsed(days=30),
  ),
]
```

## Docker Container Usage ##
The below command assumes you to have your rules configuration file `rules.py` in the current working directory.

To run the container use the following command:

```bash
# Dry mode - log artifacts that will be removed
docker run \
    --mount type=bind,source=./rules.py,target=/tmp/rules.py \
    -e ARTIFACTORY_USER=<username> \
    -e ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD=<password> \
    -e ARTIFACTORY_URL=<artifactory url> \
    -e ARTIFACTORY_RULES_CONFIG=/tmp/rules.py \
    devopshq/artifactory-cleanup:latest

# Destroy mode - remove artifacts
docker run \
    --mount type=bind,source=./rules.py,target=/tmp/rules.py \
    -e ARTIFACTORY_USER=<username> \
    -e ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD=<password> \
    -e ARTIFACTORY_URL=<artifactory url> \
    -e ARTIFACTORY_RULES_CONFIG=/tmp/rules.py \
    -e ARTIFACTORY_DESTROY_MODE_ENABLED="true" \
    devopshq/artifactory-cleanup:latest
```

The environment variables specify the necessary `artifactory-cleanup` arguments.    

In case you have set up your Artifactory self-signed certificates, place all certificates of the chain of trust into the `docker/certificates/` folder and add an additional argument `--mount type=bind,source=./certificates/,target=/mnt/self-signed-certs/` to a command.

To build the container image locally run the following command in the folder of the `Dockerfile`.


```bash
docker build . --tag artifactory-cleanup
```
# FAQ

## How to clean up Conan repository?
The idea came from https://github.com/devopshq/artifactory-cleanup/issues/47

```python
from artifactory_cleanup import rules
from artifactory_cleanup import CleanupPolicy
RULES = [
    # ------ ALL REPOS --------
    CleanupPolicy(
       'Delete files older than 60 days',
        rules.repo('conan-testing'),
        rules.delete_not_used_since(days=60),
        # Make sure to keep conan metadata. See also
        # https://github.com/devopshq/artifactory-cleanup/issues/47
        rules.exclude_filename(['.timestamp', 'index.json']),
    ),
    CleanupPolicy(
       'Delete empty folders',
        rules.repo('conan-testing'),
        rules.delete_empty_folder(),
        # Exclude metadata files
        # If a folder only contains these files, consider it as empty
        rules.exclude_filename(['.timestamp', 'index.json']),
    ),
]
```


# Release

In order to provide a new release of `artifactory-cleanup`, there are two steps involved.

1. Bump the version in the [setup.py](setup.py)
2. Create a Git release tag (e.g. `v0.3.3`) by creating a release on Github
