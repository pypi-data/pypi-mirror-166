#  VIABEL: *V*ariational *I*nference and *A*pproximation *B*ounds that are *E*fficient and *L*ightweight
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jhuggins/viabel.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jhuggins/viabel) [![Code Coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/jhuggins/viabel/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/jhuggins/viabel) [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/viabel/badge/?version=latest)](https://viabel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)


VIABEL is a library (still in early development) that provides two types of
functionality:

1. A lightweight, flexible set of methods for variational inference that is
agnostic to how the model is constructed. All that is required is a
log density and its gradient.
2. Methods for computing bounds on the errors of the mean, standard deviation,
and variance estimates produced by a continuous approximation to an
(unnormalized) distribution. A canonical application is a variational
approximation to a Bayesian posterior distribution.
