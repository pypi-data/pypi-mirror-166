    It is composed by multiple attributes:

     + :attr:`priority` defines the priority of the petition.
     + :attr:`id` is a unique identifier for the petition.
     + :attr:`queue` is a :py:class:`Queue <multiprocessing.Queue>` that can

    This class is intended to be a stub so your implementation must inherit
    from this one.
