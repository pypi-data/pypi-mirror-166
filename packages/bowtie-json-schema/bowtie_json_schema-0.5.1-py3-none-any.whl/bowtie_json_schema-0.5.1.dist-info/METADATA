Bowtie is a *meta*-validator of the `JSON Schema specification <https://json-schema.org/>`_, by which we mean it coordinates executing *other* `validator implementations <https://json-schema.org/implementations.html>`_, collecting and reporting on their results.

To do so it defines a simple input/output protocol (specified in `this JSON Schema <https://github.com/python-jsonschema/bowtie/blob/main/io-schema.json>`_ which validator implementations can implement, and it provides a CLI which can execute supported implementations.

It's called Bowtie because it fans in lots of JSON then fans out lots of results: ``>·<``. Looks like a bowtie, no?
Also because it's elegant – we hope.


Execution
---------

In general, executing ``bowtie`` consists of providing 2 pieces of input:

    * The names of one or more supported implementations to execute
    * One or more test cases to run against these implementations (schemas, instances and optionally, expected validation results)

Given these, ``bowtie`` will report on the result of executing each implementation against the input schema/instance pairs.
If expected results are provided, it will compare the results produced against the expected ones, reporting on any implementations which differ from the expected output.

CLI
===

A sample invocation of the CLI is:

.. code:: sh

    $ bowtie run -i some/jsonschema-implementation/docker-image <<EOF
    {"description": "stuff", "schema": {}, "tests": [{"description": "a test", "instance": {"foo": "bar"}}] }
    EOF
    {"valid": true}

(TODO)

Uses
----

A key use of ``bowtie`` is in executing as input the `official test suite <https://github.com/json-schema-org/JSON-Schema-Test-Suite>`_ and comparing the results produced by implementations to the expected ones from the suite.

Of course one isn't limited to just the test cases in the test suite, as ``bowtie`` can be used to compare the validation results of any input across its supported implementations.

Adding an Implementation
------------------------

Add a ``Dockerfile`` which runs as its entry point a bowtie-compatible process to the ``implementations/`` directory in the root of this repository.

Name your directory ``<(ascii-compatible-name-of-)language-your-implementation-is-written-in>-<language-specific-package-identifier>``, so if your implementation is written in B++ and called ``flooblekins``, name the directory ``bpp-flooblekins``.
