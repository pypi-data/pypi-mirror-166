# Your ‚ú®Fancy‚ú® Project Deserves a ‚ú®Fancy‚ú® PyPI Readme! üßê

[![PyPI - Python Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/hatch-fancy-pypi-readme.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/hatch-fancy-pypi-readme)
[![Hatch project](https://img.shields.io/badge/%F0%9F%A5%9A-Hatch-4051b5.svg)](https://github.com/pypa/hatch)

*hatch-fancy-pypi-readme* is a [*Hatch*] metadata plugin for everyone who cares about the first impression of their project‚Äôs PyPI landing page.
It allows you to define your PyPI project description in terms of concatenated fragments that are based on **static strings**, **files**, and most importantly:
**parts of files** defined using **cut-off points** or **regular expressions**.

Once you‚Äôve assembled your readme, you can additionally run regular-expression substitutions over it. For instance to make relative links absolute or to linkify users and issue numbers in your changelog.

Do you want your PyPI readme to be the project readme, but without badges, followed by the license file, and the changelog section for *only the last* release?
You‚Äôve come to the right place!

> **Note**
> ‚ÄúPyPI project description‚Äù, ‚ÄúPyPI landing page‚Äù, and ‚ÄúPyPI readme‚Äù all refer to the same thing.
> In *setuptools* it‚Äôs called `long_description` and is the text shown on a project‚Äôs PyPI page.
> We refer to it as ‚Äúreadme‚Äù because that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs called in [PEP 621](https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/)-based `pyproject.toml` files.
