        Subscriber mechanic where the subscriber gets notified of something that is collected.

        collectable.subscribe(self, scale=42)

        Also use the generic CollectAble only if you know what you are doing. Our recommendation is to use the more
        specific CollectAble-Variants with more specific typing hints.
