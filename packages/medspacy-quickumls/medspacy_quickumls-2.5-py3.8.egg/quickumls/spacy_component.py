        """Instantiate SpacyQuickUMLS object

            This creates a QuickUMLS spaCy component which can be used in modular pipelines.  
            This module adds entity Spans to the document where the entity label is the UMLS CUI and the Span's "underscore" object is extended to contains "similarity" and "semtypes" for matched concepts.
            Note that this implementation follows and enforces a known spacy convention that entity Spans cannot overlap on a single token.

        Args:
            nlp: Existing spaCy pipeline.  This is needed to update the vocabulary with UMLS CUI values
            quickumls_fp (str): Path to QuickUMLS data
            overlapping_criteria (str, optional):
                    One of "score" or "length". Choose how results are ranked.
                    Choose "score" for best matching score first or "length" for longest match first.. Defaults to 'score'.
            threshold (float, optional): Minimum similarity between strings. Defaults to 0.7.
            window (int, optional): Maximum amount of tokens to consider for matching. Defaults to 5.
            similarity_name (str, optional): One of "dice", "jaccard", "cosine", or "overlap".
                    Similarity measure to be used. Defaults to 'jaccard'.
            min_match_length (int, optional): TODO: ??. Defaults to 3.
            accepted_semtypes (List[str], optional): Set of UMLS semantic types concepts should belong to.
                Semantic types are identified by the letter "T" followed by three numbers
                (e.g., "T131", which identifies the type "Hazardous or Poisonous Substance").
                Defaults to constants.ACCEPTED_SEMTYPES.
            verbose (bool, optional): TODO:??. Defaults to False.
            keep_uppercase (bool, optional): By default QuickUMLS converts all
                    uppercase strings to lowercase. This option disables that
                    functionality, which makes QuickUMLS useful for
                    distinguishing acronyms from normal words. For this the
                    database should be installed without the -L option.
                    Defaults to False.
            best_match (bool, optional): Whether to return only the top match or all overlapping candidates. Defaults to True.
            ignore_syntax (bool, optional): Whether to use the heuristcs introduced in the paper (Soldaini and Goharian, 2016). TODO: clarify,. Defaults to False
            **kwargs: QuickUMLS keyword arguments (see QuickUMLS in core.py)
