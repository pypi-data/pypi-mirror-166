Description: 
        # Jocular
        
        Jocular is a tool for **Electronically-Assisted Visual Astronomy**.
        
        Jocular supports the observation of astronomical objects in near real-time by connecting up a camera to a telescope or suitable lens. It also supports session-planning through extensive deep sky object (DSO) databases, helps to manage your captures, and
        enables the reloading of previously-captured images.
        
        Jocular is documented on <a href="https://jocular.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Read the Docs</a>.
