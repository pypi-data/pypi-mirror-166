   Please note that this is a very early version, which may still
   contain some bugs. However, the client is able to play a game from
   start to end.

This repository contains the Python package for the `Software-Challenge
Germany <https://www.software-challenge.de>`__, a programming
competition for students. The students have to develop an artificial
intelligence that plays and competes against other opponents in an
annually changing game.

   This year it is the game `Hey, danke f√ºr den
   Fisch! <https://docs.software-challenge.de/spiele/penguins>`__.

Installation
------------

The installation is quite simple with pip.

.. code:: commandline

   pip install socha

If you want to install the package manually, then you have to download
the release of your choice, unpack the package and then run ``setup.py``
with Python.

.. code:: commandline

   python setup.py install --user

This should satisfy the dependencies and you can start right away.

Getting Started
---------------

If you want to start with the Software-Challenge Python Client, you have
to import some dependencies first.

The import is kept very simple, since herewith all needed dependencies
are imported, due to changes of the ``__init__.py``. But if you want to
avoid unnecessary imports, you can of course import only what you
actually need.

.. code:: python

   from socha import *

If you now want to develop and implement your logic, then the structure
of the class should look like this.

.. code:: python

   class Logic(IClientHandler):
       gameState: GameState

       def calculate_move(self) -> Move:
           possibleMoves = self.gameState.possible_moves
           return possibleMoves[0]

       def on_update(self, state: GameState):
           self.gameState = state

       def on_error(self, logMessage: str):
           ...

The above example is the simplest working Logic you can build. As you
can see the Logic must inherit from the ``IClientHandler``, so that you
can overwrite its methods and the api knows where to find your logic.

If you're done with your version of an working player, than you have to
finish your file with this function, where you call the Starter with
your desired arguments. The following starts the client with the default
arguments.

.. code:: python

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       Starter(Logic())

If you want to run your logic from the console, you can of course pass
start arguments.

   Note that any arguments passed as startup parameters will override
   those in the code, including the ones you set yourself.

The following arguments are available:

-  ``--help`` Print the help message.
-  ``--host <host>`` The host to connect to. The default is *localhost*.
-  ``--port <port>`` The port of the host. The default is *13050*.
-  ``--reservation <reservation>`` Reservation code for a prepared game.
-  ``--room <room id>`` Room Id the client will try to connect.
-  ``--keep_alive`` If present the client will keep running, even if the
   connection to the server is terminated.
-  ``--write_log`` If present the client will write a log file to the
   current directory.
