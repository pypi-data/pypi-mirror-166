# Dynamic versioning plugin for Poetry
This is a Python 3.7+ plugin for [Poetry 1.2.0+](https://github.com/sdispater/poetry)
to enable dynamic versioning based on tags in your version control system,
powered by [Dunamai](https://github.com/mtkennerly/dunamai).

The package `poetry-dynamic-versioning-plugin` has been merged into
[`poetry-dynamic-versioning`](https://pypi.org/project/poetry-dynamic-versioning),
under the optional feature named `plugin`. Please install that package instead.
