# Noughts & Crosses (Tic Tac Toe)

[![RunTests](https://github.com/vyalovvldmr/onx/actions/workflows/run_tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/vyalovvldmr/onx/actions/workflows/run_tests.yml)

Noughts & Crosses (Tic Tac Toe) terminal based, client-server online game with your partner through websockets.

## Requires

Python 3.10

## Install

```
$ pip install onx
```

or

```
$ poetry shell
$ poetry add onx
```

## Play Game

For running your game board just type in a terminal:

```
$ onx
```

You will see a game board in a waiting for your partner state.

Then ask your partner to run the same cli command with **exactly** the same cli options.
You will be matched to your partner by cli options (size and winning sequence length) on a server side.

If you are running a game with a public server than I'll suggest you to make a shorter delay between running your game board and your partners board. Just for reducing the probability to be matched with somebody else.

There are command line options for changing game board settings.
`-g` or `--grid-size` changes grid size.
`-w` or `--wining-length` changes winning sequence length.
`-h` or `--help` prints help.

```
$ onx -g14 -w3
```

## Run Server and Client Locally

Set up env variables.

```
$ export LOCALHOST="0.0.0.0"
$ export PORT=8888
```

Run server.

```
$ onx -d
```

Run client.

```
$ onx
```

## Run Tests

```
$ git clone git@github.com:vyalow/onx.git
$ cd onx
$ poetry shell
$ poetry install --no-root
$ pytest --cov
```

## Known Limitations

- **onx** is currently based on [textual](https://github.com/Textualize/textual) TUI framework which is awesome
  but is at an extremely early development stage. As a result you may be faced with some rendering problem like [711](https://github.com/Textualize/textual/issues/711), [710](https://github.com/Textualize/textual/issues/710).
  I'll suggest you to run a game board in a fullscreen mode for now.
- Public server is currently running on a free Heroku app. It means that a good enough SLA is not expected.

## Release

```
make release version=[patch | minor | major]
```
