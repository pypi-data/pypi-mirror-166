# Graph Data Extractor (GDE)

GDE is a simple tool that lets you overlay axes on a raster image (e.g. a jpeg from a figure), click on some data points, and then extract them as CSV.
More sophisticated alternatives are available!

GDE is maintained on [github](https://github.com/MichaelClerx/gde).

It was originally part of [Myokit](https://github.com/MichaelClerx/myokit), but is now a separate project.
