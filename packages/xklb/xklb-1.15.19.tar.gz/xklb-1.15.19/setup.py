    'long_description': '# lb: xk media library\n\nA wise philosopher once told me, "[The future is autotainment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9sZFrsjPp0)".\n\nManage large media libraries. Similar to Plex but more minimalist. Primary usage is local filesystem but also supports some virtual constructs like tracking video playlists (eg. YouTube subscriptions) and browser tabs.\n\nRequired: `ffmpeg`\n\nRecommended: `mpv`, `fish`, `firefox`\n\n## Install\n\nLinux recommended but [Windows setup instructions](./Windows.md) available.\n\n    pip install xklb\n\n    $ library\n    xk media library [lb]\n\n    local media subcommands:\n      fsadd [extract, xr]                Create a local media database; Add folders\n      subtitle                           Find subtitles for local media\n      listen [lt]                        Listen to local media\n      watch [wt]                         Watch local media\n      filesystem [fs]                    Browse files\n\n    online media subcommands:\n      tubeadd [ta]                       Create a tube database; Add playlists\n      tubelist [playlist, playlists]     List added playlists\n      tubeupdate [tu]                    Get new videos for your saved playlists\n      tubewatch [tw, tube, entries]      Watch the tube\n      tubelisten [tl]                    Listen to the tube\n\n    browser tabs subcommands:\n      tabsadd                            Create a tabs database; Add URLs\n      tabs [tb]                          Open your tabs for the day\n\n## Quick Start -- watch online media on your PC\n\n    wget https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/lb/raw/main/examples/mealtime.tw.db\n    library tubewatch mealtime.tw.db\n\n## Quick Start -- listen to online media on a chromecast group\n\n    wget https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/lb/raw/main/examples/music.tl.db\n    lb tubelisten music.tl.db -ct "House speakers"\n\n## Start -- local media\n\n### 1. Extract Metadata\n\nFor thirty terabytes of video the initial scan takes about four hours to complete. After that, rescans of the same path (or any subpaths) are much quicker--only new files will be read by `ffprobe`.\n\n    lb fsadd tv.db ./video/folder/\n\n![termtosvg](./examples/extract.svg)\n\n### 2. Watch / Listen from local files\n\n    lb wt tv.db                          # the default post-action is to do nothing after playing\n    lb wt tv.db --post-action delete     # delete file after playing\n    lb lt finalists.db --post-action=ask # ask to delete after playing\n\nTo stop playing just press Ctrl+C in either the terminal or mpv\n\n## Start -- online media\n\n### 1. Download Metadata\n\nDownload playlist and channel metadata. Break free of the YouTube algo~\n\n    lb tubeadd educational.db https://www.youtube.com/c/BranchEducation/videos\n\n[![termtosvg](./examples/tubeadd.svg "lb tubeadd example")](https://asciinema.org/a/BzplqNj9sCERH3A80GVvwsTTT)\n\nAnd you can always add more later--even from different websites.\n\n    lb tubeadd maker.db https://vimeo.com/terburg\n\nTo prevent mistakes the default configuration is to download metadata for only the most recent 20,000 videos per playlist/channel.\n\n    lb tubeadd maker.db --yt-dlp-config playlistend=1000\n\nBe aware that there are some YouTube Channels which have many items--for example the TEDx channel has about 180,000 videos. Some channels even have upwards of two million videos. More than you could likely watch in one sitting. On a high-speed connection (>500 Mbps), it can take up to five hours just to download the metadata for 180,000 videos.\n\n#### 1a. Get new videos for saved playlists\n\nTubeupdate will go through all added playlists and fetch metadata of any new videos not previously seen.\n\n    lb tubeupdate\n\n### 2. Watch / Listen from websites\n\n    lb tubewatch maker.db\n\nTo stop playing just press Ctrl+C in either the terminal or mpv\n\n## Start -- tabs (visit websites on a schedule)\n\ntabs provides a way to organize your visits to URLs that you want to visit every once in a while.\n\nIf you want to track _changes_ to websites over time there are better tools out there, like\n`huginn`, `urlwatch`, or `changedetection.io`.\n\nThe use-case of tabs are websites that you know are going to change: subreddits, games, or tools that you want to use for a few minutes every certain frequency (eg. daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly/yearly).\n\n### 1. Add your websites\n\n    lb tabsadd --frequency monthly --category fun https://old.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/top/?sort=top&t=month https://old.reddit.com/r/RedditDayOf/top/?sort=top&t=month\n\n### 2. Add lb tabs to cron\n\nlb tabs is meant to run **once per day**. Here is how you would configure it with `crontab`:\n\n    45 9 * * * DISPLAY=:0 lb tabs /home/my/tabs.db\n\nYou can also invoke tabs manually:\n\n    lb tabs -L 1  # open one tab\n\n## Things to know.db\n\nWhen the database file path is not specified, `video.db` will be created / used.\n\n    library fsadd ./tv/\n\nThe same for audio: `audio.db` will be created / used.\n\n    library fsadd --audio ./music/\n\nLikewise, `fs.db` from:\n\n    library fsadd --filesystem /any/path/\n\nIf you want to specify more than one directory you need to mention the db file explicitly.\n\n    library fsadd --filesystem one/\n    library fsadd --filesystem fs.db one/ two/\n\nOrganize via separate databases.\n\n    library fsadd --audio both.db ./audiobooks/ ./podcasts/\n    library fsadd --audio audiobooks.db ./audiobooks/\n    library fsadd --audio podcasts.db ./podcasts/ ./another/more/secret/podcasts_folder/\n\n## Usage\n\n    $ library watch -h\n    usage: lb watch [database] [optional args]\n\n        If not specified, watch will try to read video.db in the working directory:\n\n            lb watch\n\n        Override the default player (mpv):\n\n            lb does a lot of things to try to automatically use your preferred media player\n            but if it doesn\'t guess right you can make it explicit:\n\n            lb watch --player "vlc --vlc-opts"\n\n        Cast to chromecast groups:\n\n            lb watch --cast --cast-to "Office pair"\n            lb watch -ct "Office pair"  # equivalent\n\n            If you don\'t know the exact name of your chromecast group run `catt scan`\n\n        Print instead of play:\n\n            Generally speaking, you should always be able to add `-p` to check what the play queue\n            will look like before playing--even while using many other option simultaneously.\n            The results might lie when using `-OO` or `-OOO`.\n\n            lb watch --print --limit 10  # print the next 10 files\n            lb watch -p -L 10  # print the next 10 files\n            lb watch -p  # this will print _all_ the media. be cautious about `-p` on an unfiltered set\n\n            Printing modes\n\n            lb watch -p    # print in a table\n            lb watch -p p  # equivalent\n            lb watch -p a  # print an aggregate report\n            lb watch -p f  # print fields -- useful for piping to utilities like xargs or GNU Parallel\n\n            Check if you have downloaded something before\n\n            lb watch -u duration -p -s \'title\'\n\n            Print an aggregate report of deleted media\n\n            lb watch -w is_deleted=1 -p a\n            ╒═══════════╤══════════════╤═════════╤═════════╕\n            │ path      │ duration     │ size    │   count │\n            ╞═══════════╪══════════════╪═════════╪═════════╡\n            │ Aggregate │ 14 days, 23  │ 50.6 GB │   29058 │\n            │           │ hours and 42 │         │         │\n            │           │ minutes      │         │         │\n            ╘═══════════╧══════════════╧═════════╧═════════╛\n            Total duration: 14 days, 23 hours and 42 minutes\n\n            Print an aggregate report of media that has no duration information (likely corrupt media)\n\n            lb watch -w \'duration is null\' -p a\n\n            Print a list of videos which have below 1280px resolution\n\n            lb watch -w \'width<1280\' -p f\n\n            View how much time you have listened to music\n\n            lb lt -w play_count\'>\'0 -p a\n\n            See how much video you have\n\n            lb watch video.db -p a\n            ╒═══════════╤═════════╤═════════╤═════════╕\n            │ path      │   hours │ size    │   count │\n            ╞═══════════╪═════════╪═════════╪═════════╡\n            │ Aggregate │  145769 │ 37.6 TB │  439939 │\n            ╘═══════════╧═════════╧═════════╧═════════╛\n            Total duration: 16 years, 7 months, 19 days, 17 hours and 25 minutes\n\n            View all the columns\n\n            lb watch -p -L 1 --cols \'*\'\n\n            Open ipython with all of your media\n\n            lb watch -vv -p --cols \'*\'\n            ipdb> len(db_resp)\n            462219\n\n        Set the play queue size:\n\n            By default the play queue is 120--long enough that you likely have not noticed\n            but short enough that the program is snappy.\n\n            If you want everything in your play queue you can use the aid of infinity.\n\n            Pick your poison (these all do effectively the same thing):\n            lb watch -L inf\n            lb watch -l inf\n            lb watch --queue inf\n            lb watch -L 99999999999999999999999\n\n            You may also want to restrict the play queue.\n            For example, when you only want 1000 random files:\n\n            lb watch -u random -L 1000\n\n        Offset the play queue:\n\n            You can also offset the queue. For example if you want to skip one or ten media:\n\n            lb watch -S 10  # offset ten from the top of an ordered query\n\n        Repeat\n\n            lb listen                  # listen to 120 random songs (DEFAULT_PLAY_QUEUE)\n            lb listen --limit 5        #
