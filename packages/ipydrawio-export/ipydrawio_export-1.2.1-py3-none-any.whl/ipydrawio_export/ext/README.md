# `ipydrawio-export` labextensions

`ipydrawio-export` ships, and enables by default, several JupyterLab 3 _federated extensions_.
At some point in the future, these might become smaller packages, and are independently
reusable by other _federated modules_.

    - a **work-in-progress** attempt to provide an easy-to-install PDF toolchain
      for drawio (and more?)
