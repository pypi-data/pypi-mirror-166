Building my first package to upload to PyPI.

As the world is gathering more and more data, it is important to develop automated code to more quickly analyze projects.

I have spent my career analyzing economic, census, pharmaceutical and health care data.  I look back at the time I could have saved had I automated earlier.

In this package you will find automated analysis for data distribution.  A general class, a gaussian ("normal") class, and a binomial class.
