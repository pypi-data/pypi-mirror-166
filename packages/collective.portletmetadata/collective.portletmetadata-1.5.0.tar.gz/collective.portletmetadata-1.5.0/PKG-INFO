collective.portletmetadata
==========================

About
-----

collective.portletmetadata is a collection of patches that makes it possible edit
settings for each portlet assignment. We denote these settings for metadata thereby
the name of the product.

Out of the box the product provides the following features:

* Possibility for creating local portlets, i.e. portlets that will not be inherited
  even though child settings imply so.
* Possibility for adding a CSS class for a portlet assignment. These are defined
  in the controlpanel (stored in registry).
* Possibility for excluding a portlet from being indexed by Google.


Plone version compatibility
---------------------------

Version 1.3 and upwards are Plone 5 only. If you want to install/use collective.portletmetadata
on Plone 4.3, stick to version 1.2.


Usage
-----

Whenever the product is installed a "*" will be visible in the @@manage-portlets
view for each assignment. Whenever the user selects this option, he/she can edit
the metadata as described above.

See a short guide `here <http://bo.geekworld.dk/introducing-collective-portletmetadata/>`_.

Related work
------------

Ideally, this feature should be built into plone.app.portlets as described in
`PLIP 12266 <https://dev.plone.org/ticket/12266>`_ the current milestone is set to
Plone 5, but until Plone 5 is a reality this product can be used.

Changes
=======

1.5.0 (2022-09-08)
------------------

- Make our patches have no effect when the product is not activated.
  Until now, when a portlet was marked as local, it was still invisible elsewhere when the product was deactivated,
  and you could no longer change the setting.
  [maurits]

- Fix uninstall to remove our registry settings.  [maurits]

- Have a different template override for edit manager macros on Plone 6.
  This uses Bootstrap 5 classes.
  [maurits]

- Fix ImportError on Plone 6, for isDefaultPage.
  [maurits]


1.4.1 (2022-03-14)
------------------

- Fix Plone 5.0 support by downgrading the minimum ``plone.app.portlets`` version to be 3.0.0.
  The 3.x series of plone.app.portlets is the version used by Plone 5.0.
  [JeffersonBledsoe]


1.4 (2022-01-05)
----------------

- Fix for Plone 5.2 and Python 3 compatibility.
  Should still work on Plone 5.0 and between as well.
  [maurits]


1.3 (2018-01-17)
----------------

- Fix case in managing groups-and contenttype-portlets when the query-string
  is no longer in the request.
  [kroman0, pbauer]

- Plone 5 compatibility - this release requires plone 5 (p.a.portlets >= 4.0.0)
  [sunew]

- uninstall profile
  [sunew]


1.2 (2014-04-22)
----------------

- Allow ``class|descriptive title`` as format in the control panel.
  When this format is used, we show the title in de portlet metadata
  edit form.  A simple ``class`` is of course still supported.
  [maurits]

- Support the local portlet checkbox for ContentWellPortlets.
  [mauritsvanrees]
