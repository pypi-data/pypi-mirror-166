class Abhakliste:
    """Abhakliste is a minimal task runner that prints a list of tasks and their status.

    The object provides several methods such as
    [run_context()][abhakliste.abhakliste.Abhakliste.run_context] and
    [run_cmd()][abhakliste.abhakliste.Abhakliste.run_cmd] that can be used
    to run tasks in sequence.
    The status of each task is printed to the console.
    If a task fails, the error message and its traceback are printed to the console but the program
    continues.
    Otherwise all output to stdout and stderr is suppressed.
    At the end of the program, the object can be used to raise an exception if any
    of the tasks failed.
    This can be used to fail a CI build if any of the tasks failed.

    Example:
        ```python
        from time import sleep
        from abhakliste import Abhakliste

        # Create a new Abhakliste instance.
        abhaker = Abhakliste()

        # Run first task in context
        with abhaker.run_context(desc="Test 1"):
            sleep(1)

        # Run second task as cmd
        abhaker.run_cmd(["ls", "-l"], desc="Test 2"):

        def _test3():
            sleep(1)
