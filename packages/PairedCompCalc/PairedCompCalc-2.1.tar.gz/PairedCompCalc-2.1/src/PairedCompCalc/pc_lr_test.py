"""This module defines a function to do a likelihood ratio test
for the statistical significance of any quality parameters deviating from zero,
in the MEAN for the population from which test subjects were recruited.

*** NOT USED in version >= 2.1 ***

The NULL hypothesis is that the mean quality parameters are EQUAL
for all tested objects in all test conditions,
in the population from which test subjects were recruited.

A separate test is done for each perceptual Attribute
and each Group of subjects.

NOTE: the resulting p-value is calculated using Wilks' theorem
for the ASYMPTOTIC Chi-2 distribution of the test statistic,
and may therefore be incorrect for small samples.
