# ^ this 'shebang' is VERY IMPORTANT - include it in any R file you want to run.
# see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix) for more info.

# Here you can install any packages you want to use, e.g.
#
#     if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
#         install.packages("BiocManager")
#     }
#
#     BiocManager::install("tximport")
#     BiocManager::install("GenomicFeatures")
#
# Note that every time you update this file, builds will take a LONG time to
# complete, as all packages will be reinstalled. Exercise caution inversely
# proportional to the amount of free time you have.
