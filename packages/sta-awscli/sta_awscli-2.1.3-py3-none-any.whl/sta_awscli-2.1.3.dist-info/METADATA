# sta-awscli
## MFA for AWS CLI using SafeNet Trusted Access (STA)


This script allows using SafeNet Trusted Access (STA) IDP based authentication when working with AWSCLI. At the moment, the supported configuration is using Keycloak (https://www.keycloak.org) as an "agent" between STA and AWS, allowing us to support AWS with multiple accounts and roles.
The script assumes STA and Keycloak are configured and working for SAML based access to AWS.

The script supports all STA authentication methods, including manual OTP, Push based OTP and GriDsure.
GriDsure support is experimental and requires "tesseract" v4.0 and above to be installed on the host (https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html).

## Configuration

On first execution, the script will collect the required information to create a configuration file (sta-awscli.config) that is stored in ~\\.aws folder. It's possible to run the script with -c switch to specify an alternative location for the config file or --update-config to overwrite existing configurations.

The configuration file includes:  

- AWS Region
- Keycloak URL
- Keycloak version
- Keycloak Realm Name
- AWS application name in Keycloak
- STA Username (optional)

For example:
```
[config]
aws_region =  
cloud_idp =  
is_new_kc =  
tenant_reference_id =  
aws_app_name =  
sta_username =
```
## Usage

Once the configuration is created, a connection is established to STA through Keycloak and the user will be asked to provide a username, based on STA authentication policy, AD Password and OTP. If the user only has single token (MobilePASS+ or GriDsure) assigned, the authentication will be triggered automatically (Push for MobilePASS+ or the pattern grid presented for GriDsure). For auto triggered Push - the user can cancel the Push using CTRL+C to manually enter OTP.
If the user has multiple tokens assigned, the user is aksed to provide an OTP, but still has the abbility to trigger Push ("p" or blank OTP) and GriDsure ("g").

After successful  authentication, if a user has a single role assigned, an Access Token is generated and stored in .aws\credentials file. If the user has multiple roles assigned, the user is presented with the list of available roles to select the desired role and an Access Token is generated and stored.

## FIDO Support

sta-awscli supports FIDO2 (WebAuthn) authentication. To be able to use your FIDO authenticator, it first has to be enrolled in STA (https://thalesdocs.com/sta/operator/authentication/fido/index.html). To use the FIDO authenticator, STA policy for Keycloak has to be adjust to require FIDO authentication. The following authenticators have been tested:

- SafeNet eToken FIDO
- SafeNet IDPrime FIDO
- Yubico Yubikey
- Crayonic KeyVault

## Switches

```
 $ sta-awscli -h                                   
sta-awscli (version) MFA for AWS CLI using SafeNet Trusted Access (STA)

usage: sta-awscli [-h] [-v] [-c CLI_CONFIG_PATH] [--update-config] [-u USERNAME]
                  [-r [REGION] | --region [{eu-north-1,ap-south-1,eu-west-3,eu-west-2,eu-west-1,
                                            eu-central-1,ap-northeast-3,ap-northeast-2,ap-northeast-1,
                                            ap-east-1,ap-southeast-1,ap-southeast-2,sa-east-1,

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --version         show program's version number and exit
  -d, --debug           Enable verbose log to stdout & file (default: .\debug.log)
  -c CLI_CONFIG_PATH, --config CLI_CONFIG_PATH
                        Specify script configuration file path
  --update-config       Force update sta-awscli configuration file
  -u USERNAME, --username USERNAME      
                        Specify your SafeNet Trusted Access Username
  -l ISOCODE, --language ISOCODE
                        Specify the short ISO code for the language locale, default: en
  -r [REGION]           Specify any AWS region (without input checking)
  --region [REGION]     Specify AWS region (e.g. us-east-1)

```

## Tested OS

The script has been tested on the following OS:

- Windows
- macOS
- Linux
  - Ubuntu
  - RedHat Enterprise Linux (8.4) - for GriDsure support, requires: Python-devel, GCC, LibGL and Fuse to be installed
  - Fedora - for GriDsure support, requires: Python-devel, GCC, LibGL and Fuse to be installed
