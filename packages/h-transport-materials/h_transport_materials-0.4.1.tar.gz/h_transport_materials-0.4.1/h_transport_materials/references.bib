	abstract = {This paper presents the results of deuterium implantation/permeation experiments and TMAP4 simulations for a CuCrZr alloy, for OFHC-Cu and for a Cu/Be bi-layered structure at temperatures from 700 to 800 K. Experiments used a mass-analyzed, 3-keV D3+ ion beam with particle flux densities of 5×1019 to 7×1019 D/m2 s. Effective diffusivities and surface molecular recombination coefficients were derived giving Arrhenius pre-exponentials and activation energies for each material: CuCrZr alloy, (2.0×10−2 m2/s, 1.2 eV) for diffusivity and (2.9×x10−14 m4/s, 1.92 eV) for surface molecular recombination coefficients; OFHC Cu, (2.1×10−6 m2/s, 0.52 eV) for diffusivity and (9.1×10−18 m4/s, 0.99 eV) for surface molecular recombination coefficients. TMAP4 simulation of permeation data measured for a Cu/Be bi-layer sample was achieved using a four-layer structure (Cu/BeO interface/Be/BeO back surface) and recommended values for diffusivity and solubility in Be, BeO and Cu.},

	title = {Self-diffusion and impurity diffusion of hydrogen, oxygen, sulphur and phosphorus in copper},
	abstract = {A study on the mobility of hydrogen, oxygen, sulphur, and phosphorus in copper has been made.
In addition, the self-diffusion of copper has also been studied. Literature data has been reviewed,
and used to evaluate the temperature expressions of the diffusion coefficients of these elements in
copper. The interstitial elements oxygen and hydrogen have been described by a single temperature
expression in the whole temperature range, whereas the substitutional elements copper, sulphur,
and phosphorus have been modelled according to lattice diffusion at high temperatures and grain
boundary diffusion at low temperatures.
Sulphur, phosphorus, and copper are believed to be nearly immobile within the crystalline grains
at low temperature, even for time periods up to 100,000 years. On the other hand, in the grain
boundaries these elements can diffuse and an upper limit estimate of the possible diffusion distance
has been made. At room temperature sulphur can diffuse up to 5 cm for 100,000 years, whereas both
phosphorus and copper requires more than 1,000 000 years to diffuse the same distance. The oxygen
atom shows a similar mobility, although it is interstitially diffusing through the grains. However,
since both oxygen and sulphur have a very low solubility any measureable mass transport of these
elements will never take place at low temperatures. They will instead form oxides and sulphides in
the material.
Hydrogen is a mobile element, and will be able to diffuse through 5 cm of copper during a time period
of 1,000 years at room temperature. The diffusion of hydrogen in copper is experimentally well studied
down to room temperature. By combining the evaluated hydrogen diffusion coefficient with the
thermodynamically calculated hydrogen content in solid solution the permeability of hydrogen can be
explained. This can be used to explain the mass-transport of hydrogen for different times, temperatures,
and hydrogen activities (pressures).},

Issues of safety and fuel economy include the potential for inventory buildup and permeation of tritium implanted into the plasma-facing surface. This paper reports on laboratory-scale studies with 3 keV D+3 ion beams to investigate the hydrogen transport behavior in tungsten coatings on substrates of copper. These experiments entailed measurements of the deuterium re-emission and permeation rates for tungsten, copper, and tungsten-coated copper specimens at temperatures ranging from 638 to 825 K and implanting particle fluxes of approximately 5 × 1019 D/m2 s. Diffusion constants and surface recombination coefficients with enhancement factors due to sputtering were obtained from these measurements. These data may be used in calculations to estimate permeation rates and inventory buildups for proposed diverter designs.},

From the data on tritium residence time obtained in PH2 = 3000 Pa, the diffusion coefficient of tritium was determined as follows: D/m2s−1 = 2.50 × 10−7exp(−27.0 kJmol−1/RT), which was slightly larger than the other literature values.},

	abstract = {In the helium cooled lithium lead (HCLL) blanket for DEMO the breeding material is represented by eutectic lead lithium alloy flowing in poloidal–radial direction in the breeding module. The low solubility of hydrogen isotopes in the alloy generates an high partial pressure and, as a consequence, an high tritium permeation rate from the breeder into the He coolant and a considerable tritium inventory in the structural materials. Several experiments, devoted to determine the hydrogen solubility in lead lithium, have been performed in the past, giving contradictory results. To find a reliable value to be used in the safety analysis and in the design of both the tritium extraction system and the coolant purification system, the solubility of hydrogen (SOLE) experiment was launched in ENEA Brasimone in 2002. The SOLE device is based on the use of the absorption technique. The experimental results are in good agreement with the ones obtained in the past with similar techniques, varying from 1×10−2molm−3Pa−1/2 up to 7×10−2molm−3Pa−1/2.

The InK vs. XPb, data, fitted to a thermodynamic model, yielded a semi-empirical equation which produced (1) Sieverts' constants within the measured temperature and composition ranges, (2) an inflection point at XPb, ∼0.3, presumably caused by the formation of partly ionic Li-Pb bonds, (3) a steady decrease in the temperature coefficient as a function of XPb, resulting in a sign reversal at XPb ∼0.6, and (4) Sieverts' constant estimates for pure liquid lead.

It was found that, at the atom fraction XLi = 0.78, corresponding to the composition “Li7Pb2”, the solubility in the solid phase is lower by a factor of a few hundred than that in the liquid phase. The solubility of deuterium in the Li-Pb system decreases drastically with decreasing XLi. At about XLi = 0.17, which corresponds to the eutectic “Li17Pb83”, the solubility is independent of temperature.

The diffusivities from 200K to 3000K are calculated and the diffusion equation is fitted to D=5.13×10−8exp(−0.21eV/kT)m2/s. The diffusion equations in different temperature ranges of 200–500K, 500–2400K and 2400–3000K are also given separately and the results imply different H diffusion modes in different temperature ranges, which is proved by analyzing equilibrium H positions at low and high temperatures. The H atom jumps between different tetrahedral interstitial sites (TISs) at lower temperatures, but the transition to octahedral interstitial sites (OISs) is also observed at high temperatures. Moreover, with a vacancy present in the W system, vacancy trapping of H is observed, and it is shown that the vacancy trapping reduces with the increasing temperature. The H binding energy to monovacancy is obtained using three different methods including NEB and fitting both H diffusivity and time for H to detrap from the vacancy, which provides more information of the H behaviors with the existence of defects.},

	abstract = {Understanding the interaction between atomic hydrogen and solid tungsten is important for the development of fusion reactors in which proposed tungsten walls would be bombarded with high energy particles including hydrogen isotopes. Here, we report results from periodic density-functional theory calculations for three crucial aspects of this interaction: surface-to-subsurface diffusion of H into W, trapping of H at vacancies, and H-enhanced decohesion, with a view to assess the likely extent of hydrogen isotope incorporation into tungsten reactor walls. We find energy barriers of (at least) 2.08 eV and 1.77 eV for H uptake (inward diffusion) into W(001) and W(110) surfaces, respectively, along with very small barriers for the reverse process (outward diffusion). Although H dissolution in defect-free bulk W is predicted to be endothermic, vacancies in bulk W are predicted to exothermically trap multiple H atoms. Furthermore, adsorbed hydrogen is predicted to greatly stabilize W surfaces such that decohesion (fracture) may result from high local H concentrations.},

This model yields temperature-dependent data that can help understanding macro-scale experimental results. Within this model, the concentrations of trapped hydrogen atoms at thermodynamic equilibrium are established. Taking into account the configurational entropy, hydrogen is shown to induce vacancy formation below 1000K. Based on this model, TDS spectra are simulated with a basic kinetic model to provide some better insight into the desorption process of hydrogen. Finally, revised mechanisms for hydrogen diffusion in tungsten are proposed; we conclude that the discrepancy existing between the experimental diffusion coefficient measured by Frauenfelder (1969) and the one calculated by DFT would be reconciled provided one uses two different diffusion regimes that would depend on temperature and vacancies concentration.},

A time sequence of the permeation rate shows a spike at intermediate temperatures as seen previously, while the maximum permeation rate tends to be saturated at high temperatures. These permeation behaviors have also been observed for Al the surface of which was covered by an oxide not removed by deuteron bombardment. The saturated permeation rate (Jp) is well expressed by Jp = rφ/d (r, φandd are the range of the incident ion, the incident flux, and th e specimen thickness, respectively), which is deduced from the assumption that both the reemission and the permeation are controlled by the diffusion process. According to recombination theory, the permeation rate should be much higher because the reemission is delayed by the surface oxide or other contaminants with small recombination coefficients. Therefore the recombination theory seems not to be applicable for the estimation of the ion driven permeation with high incident energies at above 500 K as made in the present work.},

Furthermore, the specimen thickness dependence of the steady state permeation current density was examined and consequently, the diffusion of hydrogen through the Cu foil in the permeation process was the rate determining step.(2) The diffusivity in the annealed Cu did not depend on the cathodic current densities in the range of ic=2.5 to 250 A·m−2, i.e., the hydrogen concentration in the cathodic surface, but in the case of as-cold-rolled Cu, it was slightly low, when the hydrogen was introduced at low ic values.

	abstract = {Interest in molten salts has increased significantly over the last decade due to their potential application in various clean-energy technologies including hydrogen generation, solar heat storage, advanced fission nuclear power plants, and compact fusion energy systems. In nuclear fission and fusion power plants, high heat capacity molten salts allow operation at high temperature and atmospheric pressure, which could dramatically increase efficiency, reduce capital cost, and enable passive safety features. In many of these systems, the hydrogen isotope is of particular importance due to its ability to corrode structural materials as 3H+ in fluoride salts, and its potential to cause significant radioactive release as diffusive 3H0, which are cited as key barriers to technological deployment. Yet, the chemistry and transport behavior of the hydrogen species remain poorly understood due to the difficulties in handling toxic salts and radioactive materials. Here, using ab initio molecular dynamics, we present a coupled examination of hydrogen speciation in the most common prototypical salts 66.6\% LiF–33.3\% BeF2 (Flibe) and 46.5\% LiF–11.5\% NaF–42\% KF (Flinak). Using extensively validated calculations on the local structure and dynamics, we find significant difference between 3H0 and 3H+ transport behaviors that are usually overlooked. We find that 3H0, which always exists as H2, diffuses 3–5 times faster than 3H+, which can be ascribed to hydrogen bonding and complexation in solution. This work explains contradicting experimental results and provides useful species transport data for designing hydrogen capture and corrosion control systems for molten salts.},

On the basis of previous studies, the diffusivity and solubility of hydrogen in FLiNaK have been revised, and the expressions can be correlated to the following Arrhenius equations: DH2 = 1.62 × 10−5exp (−48.20 × 103/Rg·T) [m2/s] and SH2 = 1.03 × 10−4exp (−14.96 × 103/Rg·T) [mol-H2/m3/Pa], respectively. The behavior characteristics of deuterium in FLiNaK were studied and compared with the hydrogen behaviors in FLiNaK. The results showed the behaviors of deuterium were consistence with the behaviors of hydrogen in FLiNaK. The difference between hydrogen and deuterium has not been observed upon the experimental research of the behavior characteristics of hydrogen and deuterium in FLiNaK, which suggested the results obtained here might apply equally to the behavior characteristics of tritium in FLiNaK.},

	abstract = {In order to provide data on diffusion coefficients and solubility constants of tritium in molten salts for the critical issue of tritium control in the Thorium Molten Salt Reactor (TMSR) program, a two-chamber permeability apparatus separated by a nickel plate had been developed for determining the permeability of hydrogen isotope in molten salts. Descriptions on the permeability apparatus, experimental procedure and the analytical method for determining the diffusivity and solubility of hydrogen isotope in molten salts were presented in this paper. To assess the performance of the apparatus, the blank tests without molten salt were conducted at 300-700 degrees C. The results showed that the nickel plate acting as the window for hydrogen isotope permeation in the apparatus seemed to have less effect on experiments of determining the permeability of hydrogen isotope in molten slat at 500-700 degrees C. Furthermore, the applicability of the apparatus with molten salt was also evaluated experimentally, with test experiments of molten Flinak (LiF-NaF-KF) at 500 degrees C, 600 degrees C and 700 degrees C. Diffusion coefficients and solubility constants of hydrogen in molten Flinak can be derived from those test experiments, which were correlated to DFlinak-H = 7.06 x 10(-5) e(-54.9/(RgT)) m(2)/S and SFlinak-H = 1.67 x 10(-7) e(-27.0/(RgT)) mol-H-2/(m(3) Pa).},

	abstract = {Hydrogen isotopes solubility in eutectic lithium–lead alloys is really important for the design of breeding blanket components that use this breeding material. The determination of the magnitude and kinetics of the tritium flux from the blanket to the helium cooling loop, along with the design of future tritium extraction systems of the breeding alloy or the He coolant purification system, will be defined on basic transport parameters such as solubility. The unacceptable scattering of Sieverts’ constant values in the historical measurements given by different experimental techniques, suggests that this is a very important and unresolved issue. In this work, it has been experimentally evaluated, using absorption and desorption techniques. The different measurement campaigns have been carried out in the temperature range from 523 to 922K and in the pressure range from 1 to 105Pa. This paper describes the work carried out in the preparation of the facility, the theoretical model developed to process the different results obtained by means of absorption and desorption runs. Final results obtained during several campaigns of measurements are provided. The obtained values of hydrogen solubility through the different campaigns show a similar value for the Sieverts’ constant, and therefore, a very little value for the activation energy in the solution process. Results are compared and discussed. The proposed correlation for hydrogen Sieverts’ constant in Pb–Li from these tests is KS [molm−3Pa−1/2]=8.64×10−3exp(–0.9/RT), R in (kJK−1mol−1).},
