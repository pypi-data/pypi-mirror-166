# Jacdac Python

A Python client and server SDK for Jacdac. This SDK is not compatible with micropython or circuit python.

**Jacdac** is a plug-and-play hardware/software stack
for **microcontrollers** and their peripherals (sensors/actuators),
with applications to rapid prototyping, making, and physical computing.

The rest of this page is for developers of the `jacdac-python` library.

## Development

This section explains how to develop this library locally.

### WSL setup

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install --upgrade -y python3 python3-pip ipython3 python3-venv python3-libgpiod
```

### Codespaces

You can develop this package from a GitHub codespace container. 
No configuration changes is needed, follow the regular installation steps.

The devtools web site will be forwarded by GitHub and you will be able to connect to physical hardware
from the browser while testing the Python running on the codespace container. 

### Raspberry Pi Setup

You'll need a JacHAT for Raspberry Pi and you will need to build bridge executable,
see https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-stm32x0/tree/main/spibridge

### Build package

Install the build tools

```
python -m pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

Create the library bundle

```
python -m build
```

The build system uses [Angular commit syntax](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#commits) to automatically generate releases.

### Devtools

The devtools script allows to run a Jacdac dashboard connected through a websocket. This allows
to pipe packets from the python library into the web developer tools and diagnose issues over there

To launch the developer tools server (once per session)

```bash
python -m jacdac.devtools
```

### Examples

With the devtools running, you can run snippets from the `examples` folder:

```bash
python -m examples.blinky
```
