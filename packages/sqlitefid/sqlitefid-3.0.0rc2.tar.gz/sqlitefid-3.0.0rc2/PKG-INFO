# sqlitefid

SQLite Abstraction of Format Identification Tools (DROID, Siegfried)

## History

* Separated code from https://github.com/exponential-decay/droid-siegfried-sqlite-analysis-engine.
* Has been a standalone app from the beginning but may have application for others isolated like this. 
* Inspired by [Siegfried's](https://github.com/richardlehane/siegfried) use of namespaces to be generic enough for
a number of format identification tools. 
* FIDO identification available but not parsing. Could be on its way but depends on demand. 

## License

GPLV3 because why not.
