# yawgbot

Yet Another WG helper bot. WG stands for *Wohngemeinschaft*, a German word that refers to a living arrangement in which
several tenants share an apartment. It is aimed to automate the extremely complex and time-consuming task of finding a
room or an apartment to rent. Initially it was only working for [wg-gesucht.de](https://wg-gesucht.de), now it's a
plugin-based system ready to be extended for every platform to find accommodation.

`yawgbot` is a simple python bot that scrapes websites offering accommodation ads and contacts landlords. It uses a
SQLite database to save contacted ads and to perform fewer requests to platforms. It also offers a simple web UI to
track your progress and gather your findings across different platforms.

## running manually

To run the bot manually:

+ install the package with `pip3 install yawgbot` (a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) is suggested)
+ configure `.env.sample` and rename it to `.env`
+ create a new file named `bot.py` with the following content and run it:

```python
from yawgbot import Bot
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

bot = Bot(platfors=["wg-gesucht"])
bot.run()
```

## running periodically with celery and web UI

Yawgbot uses [Celery](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/) to schedule tasks. It is
configured to use [SQLite](https://sqlite.org) as
both [backend and broker](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/getting-started/backends-and-brokers/index.html), to know
more read the docs. The file `run_yawgbot.py` is provided to run the bot each 5 minutes, to use it:

- run `celery -A run_yawgbot.celery worker --loglevel=INFO` to run the worker
- run `celery -A run_yawgbot.celery beat` to schedule the bot
