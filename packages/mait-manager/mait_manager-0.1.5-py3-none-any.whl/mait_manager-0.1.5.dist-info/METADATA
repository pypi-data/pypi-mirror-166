The above demonstrates how to upload a single file **(You cannot upload multiple files at this time.)**
### Uploading.
```commandline
mait upload
```
Code must be source code! Compiled sources are not allowed!
### Providing a JSON.
```json
{
  "exec": "python3 donut.py"
}
```
A JSON provides the command to compile/or interpret the code & is required.

**Uploading requires for the file to be reviewed since malicious code can easily be run.**
