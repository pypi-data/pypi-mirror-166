**Note:** I only have playstations, so I don't know if this will work with
other joysticks.

This is actually something I did long ago, but finally decided to make
it a module available on PyPi.

## Setup

This requires `sdl2` inorder to work:

```bash
brew install sdl2       # macos
apt install libsdl2-dev # linux
```

This package will install the python bindings `PySDL2` from pypi.

Tested:

- Works with joystick connected via USB cable
- Works with joystick connected via bluetooth
- Works with PS4 controller
- Works with PS5 controller

## Example

So really, there is no difference between `PS4Joystick` amd `PS5Joystick`,
but both classes exist. Originally I hoped there would be a difference,
like access to the gyros and accelerometers, but there isn't.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import time
from clamps import PS4Joystick

def main():
    import time

    js = PS4Joystick() # or PS5Joystick()

    while js.valid:
        try:
            ps4 = js.get()
            print(ps4,"\n----------------------\n")
            time.sleep(0.1)
            if ps4.buttons.pad is True:
                break
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            print('js exiting ...')
            break


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Output of `get()` is a `namedtuple` with the following fields:

```python
JS(info=JSInfo(num_buttons=16, num_axes=6, num_hats=0), leftstick=Axis(x=-0.003936767578125, y=0.011749267578125), rightstick=Axis(x=-0.01177978515625, y=-0.050994873046875), triggers=Axis(x=0.0, y=0.0), buttons=PS4Buttons(x=False, circle=False, square=False, triangle=False, share=False, ps=False, options=False, L3=False, R3=False, L1=False, R1=False, dp_up=False, dp_down=False, dp_left=False, dp_right=False, pad=True))
```

## [How to pair a DUALSHOCK 4 wireless controller with a supported device][ref]

To pair your wireless controller with a supported device using Bluetooth for the first time, turn on pairing mode.

1. Make sure the player indicator on the controller is off.
If the player indicator is on, press and hold the PS button until it turns off. If a USB is connected to the controller, disconnect it.
1. While pressing and holding the SHARE button, press and hold the PS Button until the light bar flashes.
1. Enable Bluetooth on your device, and then select the controller from the list of Bluetooth devices. When pairing is complete, the light bar blinks, and then the player indicator lights up.
