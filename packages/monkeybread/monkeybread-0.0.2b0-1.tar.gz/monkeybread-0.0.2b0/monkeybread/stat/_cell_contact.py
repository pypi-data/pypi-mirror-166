    Parameters
    ----------
    adata
        Annotated data matrix.
    groupby
        A categorical column in `adata.obs` to classify groups.
    group1
        Either one group or a list of groups from `adata.obs[groupby]`.
    group2
        Either one group or a list of groups from `adata.obs[groupby]`.
    actual_contact
         The actual cell contacts, as calculated by `monkeybread.calc.cell_contact`.
    contact_radius
        The radius in which cells are considered touching. If not provided, will be calculated using
        half of the average radius of group1 + half of the average radius of group2. This requires
        width and height columns to be present in `adata.obs`. Should be the same as used in
        `monkeybread.calc.cell_contact`.
    perm_radius
        The radius within which to randomize location, in coordinate units.
    n_perms
        The number of permutations to run.

    Returns
    -------
    expected_touches
        An array containing the number of contacts observed for each permutation.
    p_val
        Optionally, a p_value comparing the expected contact to the actual contact. Only calculated
        if `actual_contact` is provided.
