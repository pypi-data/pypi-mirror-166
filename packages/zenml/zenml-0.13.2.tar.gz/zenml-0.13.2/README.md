# ü§ñ Why ZenML?

ü§π Are you an ML engineer or data scientist shipping models to production and juggling a plethora of tools? 

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Do you struggle with versioning data, code, and models in your projects? 

üëÄ Have you had trouble replicating production pipelines and monitoring models in production?

‚úÖ If you answered yes to any of the above, ZenML is here to help with all that and more...

Everyone loves to train ML models, but few talks about shipping them into production, and even fewer can do it well.
At ZenML, we believe the journey from model development to production doesn't need to be long and painful.

![The long journey from experimentation to production.](docs/book/assets/1-pipeline-hard-reproduce.png)


With ZenML, you can concentrate on what you do best - developing ML models and not worry about infrastructure or deployment tools.

If you come from unstructured notebooks or scripts with lots of manual processes, ZenML will make the path to production easier and faster for you and your team.
Using ZenML allows you to own the entire pipeline - from experimentation to production.

This is why we built ZenML. Read more [here](https://blog.zenml.io/why-zenml/).




# üí° What is ZenML?

<div align="center">
    <img src="docs/book/assets/tailor.gif">
</div>


ZenML is an extensible, open-source MLOps framework for creating portable, production-ready MLOps pipelines. It's built for Data Scientists, ML Engineers, and MLOps Developers to collaborate as they develop to production. 

ZenML offers a simple and flexible syntax, is cloud- and tool-agnostic, and has interfaces/abstractions catered toward ML workflows. 
With ZenML you'll have all your favorite tools in one place so you can tailor a workflow that caters to your specific needs.

![ZenML unifies all your tools in one place.](docs/book/assets/sam-side-by-side-full-text.png)

Read more on all tools you can readily use in the [integrations](https://zenml.io/integrations) section. Can't find your tool? You can always [write your own integration](https://docs.zenml.io/developer-guide/advanced-usage/custom-flavors) to use it with ZenML.

# ü§∏ Getting Started

## üíæ Installation
**Option 1** - Install ZenML via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/zenml/):

```bash
pip install zenml
```
> **Note** - ZenML supports Python 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9.

**Option 2** - If you‚Äôre feeling adventurous, try out the bleeding-edge installation:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml.git@develop --upgrade
```

> **Warning** - Fire dragons ahead. Proceed at your own risk!

**Option 3** - Install via a Docker image hosted publicly on
[DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/zenmldocker/zenml):

```shell
docker run -it zenmldocker/zenml /bin/bash
```

> **Warning** 
> #### Known installation issues for M1 Mac users
>
> If you have an M1 Mac machine and encounter an installation error, 
> try setting up `brew` and `pyenv` with Rosetta 2 and then install ZenML. The issue arises because some dependencies 
> aren‚Äôt fully compatible with the vanilla ARM64 Architecture. The following links may be helpful (Thank you @Reid Falconer) :
>
>- [Pyenv with Apple Silicon](http://sixty-north.com/blog/pyenv-apple-silicon.html)
>- [Install Python Under Rosetta 2](https://medium.com/thinknum/how-to-install-python-under-rosetta-2-f98c0865e012)


## üèá First run

If you're here for the first time, we recommend running:

```shell
zenml go
```

This spins up a Jupyter notebook that walks you through various functionalities of ZenML at a high level.

By the end, you'll get a glimpse of how to use ZenML to:

+ Train, evaluate, deploy, and embed a model in an inference pipeline.
+ Automatically track and version data, models, and other artifacts.
+ Track model hyperparameters and metrics with experiment tracking tools.
+ Measure and visualize train-test skew, training-serving skew, and data drift.

## üë®‚Äçüç≥ Open Source MLOps Stack Recipes

ZenML boasts a ton of [integrations](https://zenml.io/integrations) into popular MLOps tools. The [ZenML Stack](https://docs.zenml.io/developer-guide/stacks-profiles-repositories) concept ensures that these tools work nicely together, therefore bringing structure and standardization into the MLOps workflow.

However, ZenML assumes that the stack infrastructure for these tools is already provisioned. If you do not have deployed infrastructure, and want to quickly spin up combinations of tools on the cloud, the [MLOps stack sister repository](https://github.com/zenml-io/mlops-stacks) contains a series of Terraform-based recipes to provision such stacks. These recipes can be used directly with ZenML:

```bash
pip install zenml[stacks]

zenml stack recipe deploy <NAME_OF_STACK_RECIPE> --import
```

The above command not only provisions the given tools, but also automatically creates a ZenML stack with the configuration of the deployed recipe!

## üç∞ ZenBytes
New to MLOps? Get up to speed by visiting the [ZenBytes](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenbytes) repo.

>ZenBytes is a series of short practical MLOps lessons taught using ZenML. 
>It covers many of the [core concepts](https://docs.zenml.io/getting-started/core-concepts) widely used in ZenML and MLOps in general.

## üìú ZenFiles
Already comfortable with ZenML and wish to elevate your pipeline into production mode? Check out [ZenFiles](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenfiles).

>ZenFiles is a collection of production-grade ML use-cases powered by ZenML. They are fully fleshed out, end-to-end projects that showcase ZenML's capabilities. They can also serve as a template from which to start similar projects.

# üë≠ Collaborate with your team

ZenML is built to support teams working together. 
The underlying infrastructure on which your ML workflows run can be shared, as can the data, assets, and artifacts in your workflow. 

In ZenML, a Stack represents a set of configurations for your MLOps tools and infrastructure. You can quickly share your ZenML stack with anyone by exporting the stack:

```
zenml stack export <STACK_NAME> <FILENAME.yaml>
```

Similarly, you can import a stack by running:
```
zenml stack import <STACK_NAME> <FILENAME.yaml>
```

Learn more on importing/exporting stacks [here](https://docs.zenml.io/collaborate/stack-export-import).


The [ZenML Profiles](https://docs.zenml.io/collaborate/zenml-store) offer an easy way to manage and switch between your stacks. All your stacks, components, and other classes of ZenML objects can be stored in a central location and shared across multiple users, teams, and automated systems such as CI/CD processes.

With the [ZenServer](https://docs.zenml.io/collaborate/zenml-server) 
you can deploy ZenML as a centralized service and connect entire teams and organizations to an easy-to-manage collaboration platform that provides a unified view of the MLOps processes, tools, and technologies that support your entire AI/ML project lifecycle.

Read more about using ZenML for collaboration [here](https://docs.zenml.io/collaborate/collaborate-with-zenml).

# üó∫ Roadmap

ZenML is being built in public. The [roadmap](https://zenml.io/roadmap) is a
regularly updated source of truth for the ZenML community to understand where
the product is going in the short, medium, and long term.

ZenML is managed by a [core team](https://zenml.io/company#CompanyTeam) of developers that are
responsible for making key decisions and incorporating feedback from the
community. The team oversees feedback via various channels, and you can directly
influence the roadmap as follows:

- Vote on your most wanted feature on our [Discussion
  board](https://zenml.io/discussion).
- Start a thread in our [Slack channel](https://zenml.io/slack-invite).
- [Create an issue](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/issues/new/choose) on our Github repo.



# üôå Contributing and Community
