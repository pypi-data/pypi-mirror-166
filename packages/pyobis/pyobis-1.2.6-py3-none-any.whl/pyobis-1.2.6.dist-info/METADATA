Python client for the `OBIS API <https://api.obis.org/>`__.

`Source on GitHub at iobis/pyobis <https://github.com/iobis/pyobis>`__

What is it?
===========
Pyobis is an interesting python package that helps users fetch data from OBIS API which
holds a great amount of ocean open-data, with ease.

`The Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS), <https://obis.org>`__ a global open-access data and
information clearing-house on marine biodiversity for science, conservation, and sustainable
development, maintained by IOOS, harvests occurrence records from thousands of datasets
and makes them available as a single integrated dataset via various services including the
OBIS API.

Other OBIS clients:

* R: `robis`, `iobis/robis <https://github.com/iobis/robis>`__

Main Features
=============
Here are just a few of things pyOBIS can do:

* Easy handling of OBIS data, easy fetching without handling the raw API response directly.
* Built-in functions for ``occurrence``, ``taxon``, ``node``, ``checklist`` and ``dataset`` endpoints of OBIS API.
* Provides easy export of data to ``Pandas`` DataFrame, and helps researchers focus more on analysis rather than data mining.

For examples of how to use this repo, see the jupyter notebooks in the ``/notebooks/`` directory.
NOTE: GitHub's jupyter notebook display does not show interactive plots; open the notebooks in a jupyter hub (eg colab, binder, etc) for the full experience.

Installation
============

Install from pypi

.. code-block:: console

    pip install pyobis

Install latest dev version from github

.. code-block:: console

    pip install git+git://github.com/iobis/pyobis.git#egg=pyobis

Install editable dev version from github for local development. System prerequisites: python3, conda

Documentation
=============
The official documentation is hosted on GitHub Pages `https://iobis.github.io/pyobis <https://iobis.github.io/pyobis>`__.

Library API
===========

``pyobis`` is split up into modules for each of the groups of API methods.

* ``taxa`` - Taxonomic names
* ``occurrences`` - Occurrence search
* ``dataset`` - Dataset
* ``nodes`` - Nodes
* ``checklist`` - Checklist

You can import the entire library, or each module individually as needed.

Usage Guide
===========

For a detailed usage guide with information about inputs, output and module functions please read the `Usage Guide <notebooks/usage_guide.ipynb>`__

Sample analysis
===============

Some Jupyter Notebook based sample analysis and visualization of data grabbed through ``pyobis`` have been made available through ``/notebooks/`` directory.
To get full experience of the interactive plots (eg. geoplots, etc) please open notebooks in a Jupyter Hub (eg. through Google Colab, Binder, local installation, etc.)
