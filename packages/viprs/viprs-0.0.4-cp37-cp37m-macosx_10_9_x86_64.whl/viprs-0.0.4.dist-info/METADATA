`viprs` is a python package that implements scripts and utilities for running variational inference 
algorithms on genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for the purposes polygenic risk estimation. 

Highlighted features:

- The coordinate ascent algorithms are written in `cython` for improved speed and efficiency.
- The code is written in object-oriented form, allowing the user to extend and experiment with existing implementations.
- We provide scripts for fitting the model with different priors on the effect size: `VIPRSAlpha`, `VIPRSMix`, etc.
- We also provide scripts for different hyperparameter tuning strategies, including: Grid search, Bayesian optimization, Bayesian model averaging.

**NOTE**: The codebase is still in active development and some of interfaces or data structures will be 
replaced or modified in future releases.

## Installation

`viprs` is now available on the python package index `pypi` and 
can be minimally installed using the package installer `pip`:

```shell
pip install viprs
```

To access the full functionalities of `viprs`, however, it is recommended that 
you install the full list of dependencies:

```shell
pip install viprs[full]
```

To use `viprs` on a shared computing cluster, we recommend installing it in a 
`python` virtual environment. For example:

```shell
module load python/3.8
python -m venv viprs_env
source viprs_env/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install viprs
```

Finally, if you wish to install the package from source, 
you can directly clone the GitHub repository and install it locally 
as follows:

```
git clone https://github.com/shz9/viprs.git
cd viprs
make install
```

## Getting started

`viprs` is a `python` package for fitting Bayesian Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) models to summary statistics 
derived from Genome-wide Association Studies (GWASs). To showcase the interfaces and functionalities of the package 
as well as the data structures that power it, we will start with a simple example. 

Generally, summary statistics-based PRS methods require access to **(1)** GWAS summary statistics for the 
trait of interest and **(2)** Linkage-Disequilibrium (LD) matrices from an appropriately-matched reference panel (e.g. 
the 1000G dataset). For the first item, we will use summary statistics for standing height from the `fastGWA` catalogue. 
For the second item, we will use genotype data on chromosome 22 for a subset of 378 European samples from the 
1000G project. This small dataset is shipped with the python package `magenpy`.

To start, let's import the required `python` modules:

```python
import magenpy as mgp
import viprs as vp
```

Then, we will use `magenpy` to read the 1000G genotype dataset and *automatically* match it with the GWAS 
summary statistics from `fastGWA`:

```python
# Load genotype and GWAS summary statistics data (chromosome 22):
gdl = mgp.GWADataLoader(bed_files=mgp.tgp_eur_data_path(),
                        sumstats_files=mgp.ukb_height_fastGWA_path(),
                        sumstats_format="fastGWA")
```

Once the genotype and summary statistics data are read by `magenpy`, we can go ahead and compute 
the LD (or SNP-by-SNP correlation) matrix:

```python
# Compute LD using the shrinkage estimator (Wen and Stephens 2010):
gdl.compute_ld("shrinkage",
               output_dir="temp",
               genetic_map_ne=11400, # effective population size (Ne)
               genetic_map_sample_size=183,
               threshold=1e-3)
```

Because of the small sample size of the reference panel, here we recommend using the `shrinkage` estimator 
for LD from Wen and Stephens (2010). The shrinkage estimator results in compact and sparse LD matrices that are 
more robust than the sample LD. The estimator requires access to information about the genetic map, such as 
the position of each SNP in centi Morgan, the effective population size, and the sample size used to 
estimate the genetic map.

Given the LD information from the reference panel, we can next fit the VIPRS model to the summary statistics data:

```python
# Initialize VIPRS, passing it the GWADataLoader object
v = vp.VIPRS(gdl)
# Invoke the .fit() method to obtain posterior estimates
v.fit()
```

Once the model converges, we can generate PRS estimates for height for the 1000G samples by simply 
invoking the `.predict()` method:

```python
v.predict()
# array([ 0.01944202,  0.00597704,  0.07329462, ..., 0.06666187,  0.05251297,  0.00359018])
```

To examine posterior estimates for the model parameters, you can simply invoke the `.to_table()` method:

```python
v.to_table()
#       CHR         SNP A1 A2       PIP          BETA      VAR_BETA
# 0       22    rs131538  A  G  0.006107 -5.955517e-06  1.874619e-08

# ...    ...         ... .. ..       ...           ...           ...

```

Here, `PIP` is the **P**osterior **I**nclusion **P**robability under the variational density, while 
`BETA` and `VAR_BETA` are the posterior mean and variance for the effect size, respectively. 
For the purposes of prediction, we only need the `BETA` column. You can also examine the 
inferred hyperparameters of the model by invoking the `.to_theta_table()` method:

```python
v.to_theta_table()
#           Parameter     Value
# 0  Residual_variance  0.994231
# 1       Heritability  0.005736
# 2  Proportion_causal  0.015887
# 3         sigma_beta  0.000021
```

Note that here, the SNP heritability only considers the contribution of variants on 
chromosome 22.

## Features and Configurations 

### (1) Evaluating `viprs` with training and test data

Here, we will go through an artificial example on simulated 
phenotypes using a subset of 387 individuals from the 1000 Genomes dataset. To begin, let's use the python 
package `magenpy` to simulate a quantitative trait where 1% of the variants 
are causal and the SNP heritability set to `0.8`:

```python
g_sim = mgp.GWASimulator(mgp.tgp_eur_data_path(),
                         pi=(.99, .01),
                         h2=0.8)
g_sim.simulate()
g_sim.to_phenotype_table()
#          FID      IID  phenotype
# 0    HG00096  HG00096  -1.787443
# 1    HG00097  HG00097   0.282521
# 2    HG00099  HG00099   0.532999
# 3    HG00100  HG00100   0.781203
# 4    HG00101  HG00101   0.081900
# ..       ...      ...        ...
# 373  NA20815  NA20815   0.898588
# 374  NA20818  NA20818   1.549989
# 375  NA20819  NA20819  -0.259188
# 376  NA20826  NA20826  -0.044187
# 377  NA20828  NA20828   2.254222
#
# [378 rows x 3 columns]
```

To obtain a realistic setting where the training data is separate from the test data, next we are going to 
randomly split the samples into 80% training and 20% testing:

```python
training_gdl, test_gdl = g_sim.split_by_samples(proportions=[.8, .2])
print("Number of training samples:", training_gdl.sample_size)
# Number of training samples: 314
print("Number of test samples:", test_gdl.sample_size)
# Number of test samples: 64
```

Using the training data, we will compute LD matrices and perform GWAS 
on the simulated phenotype:

```python
# Compute LD using the shrinkage estimator:
training_gdl.compute_ld('shrinkage',
                        output_dir='temp',
                        genetic_map_ne=11400, # effective population size (Ne)
                        genetic_map_sample_size=183,
                        threshold=1e-3)
# Perform GWAS on the simulated phenotype:
training_gdl.perform_gwas()
```

And that is all we need to fit the `VIPRS` method to the training data! To perform model fit,
simply pass the `g_sim` object to `VIPRS` and then invoke the `.fit()` method:

```python
v = vp.VIPRS(training_gdl)
v.fit()
```

If everything works as expected, the method will converge reasonably fast and you should be able to 
use object to perform predictions on the test set. Once convergence is achieved, you can compute 
polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for the test samples. This can be simply done by invoking the `.predict()` method and 
passing the `test_gdl` object as an argument, as follows:

```python
test_prs = v.predict(test_gdl)
```

For the sake of comparison, we will also include the PRS based on the marginal effect sizes from GWAS:

```python
naive_prs = test_gdl.predict(beta={c: ss.marginal_beta for c, ss in training_gdl.sumstats_table.items()})
```

To evaluate the accuracy of the polygenic score, you can use some of the provided metrics with the `viprs` package. 
For quantitative traits, it is customary to report the prediction R^2, or the proportion 
of variance explained by the PRS:

```python
from viprs.eval.metrics import r2 
r2(test_prs, test_gdl.sample_table.phenotype)
# 0.171429
```

The prediction R^2 here is much lower than we would expect, given our simulation 
scenario. This is again largely due to the small sample size that we are working with and 
the noise this induces on the estimates of LD, GWAS summary statistics, etc. For reference, 
we can compare this to the R^2 from the "naive" PRS estimator:

```python
r2(naive_prs, test_gdl.sample_table.phenotype)
# 0.169567
```

In this artificial setting, `viprs` results in minor improvements in prediction accuracy 
on the test set compared to the naive PRS estimator. However, as we show in our manuscript, this 
improvement is more pronounced when we use larger sample sizes for both GWAS and the LD reference panel.

### (2) Grid search and validation

In our manuscript, we found that VIPRS paired with grid search with a held-out validation set 
performs favorably compared to the vanilla model. Here, we will illustrate how to use the grid search functionalities 
implemented in the `viprs` package. To start, let's use the same simulation scenario as before:

```python
g_sim = mgp.GWASimulator(mgp.tgp_eur_data_path(),
                         pi=(.99, .01),
                         h2=0.8)
g_sim.simulate()
g_sim.to_phenotype_table()
#         FID      IID  phenotype
# 0    HG00096  HG00096  -0.283120
# 1    HG00097  HG00097   0.060302
# 2    HG00099  HG00099  -0.571485
# 3    HG00100  HG00100   1.145548
# 4    HG00101  HG00101   0.535409
# ..       ...      ...        ...
# 373  NA20815  NA20815   0.214542
# 374  NA20818  NA20818  -0.986338
# 375  NA20819  NA20819  -0.056678
# 376  NA20826  NA20826   0.119752
# 377  NA20828  NA20828   0.889052
# 
# [378 rows x 3 columns]
```

Then, we will split this small dataset into 70% training, 15% validation, and 15% testing:

```python
training_gdl, validation_gdl, test_gdl = g_sim.split_by_samples(proportions=[.7, .15, .15])
print("Number of training samples:", training_gdl.sample_size)
# Number of training samples: 251
print("Number of validation samples:", validation_gdl.sample_size)
# Number of validation samples: 66
print("Number of test samples:", test_gdl.sample_size)
# Number of test samples: 61
```

As before, we will compute the LD and perform GWAS on the training samples:

```python
# Compute LD using the shrinkage estimator:
training_gdl.compute_ld('shrinkage',
                        output_dir='temp',
                        genetic_map_ne=11400, # effective population size (Ne)
                        genetic_map_sample_size=183,
                        threshold=1e-3)
# Perform GWAS on the simulated phenotype:
training_gdl.perform_gwas()
```

For a simple baseline, we'll examine the performance of the standard VIPRS model 
without any grid search:

```python
v = vp.VIPRS(training_gdl).fit()
```

Once converged, for this simulation scenario, the standard VIPRS results in the following prediction R^2:

```python
from viprs.eval.metrics import r2
r2(v.predict(test_gdl), test_gdl.sample_table.phenotype)
0.168073
```

To see how grid search would perform in comparison, first we construct a grid 
for some of the hyperparameters of interest, including `pi` and `sigma_epsilon`, the 
proportion of causal variants and the residual variance, respectively:

```python
# Create a grid:
grid = vp.HyperparameterGrid()
# Generate a grid for pi using 5 equidistant grid points:
grid.generate_pi_grid(steps=5, n_snps=training_gdl.n_snps)
# Generate a grid for sigma epsilon using 5 equidistant grid points:
grid.generate_sigma_epsilon_grid(steps=5)
```

This will generate a grid of 5x5=25 hyperparameter settings that we will search over. 
To fit the VIPRS model with this grid, we can simply use the `GridSearch` class, passing it 
the training data as well as the grid that we just created:

```python
vgv_gs = vp.VIPRSGridSearch(training_gdl, grid)
vgv_gs = vgv_gs.fit()
vgv.select_best_model(validation_gdl=validation_gdl, criterion='validation')
```

Here, in order to make use of the held-out validation data, we pass it the `GridSearch` object and 
we also specify that the objective that we wish to optimize is the `validation` R^2. When we call `.fit()` on 
the `GridSearch` object, it will fit 25 different VIPRS models, each with a different hyperparameter setting 
and then choose the one with the best predictive performance on the held-out validation set.

Given this "best" model, we can using to make predictions and test prediction accuracy on the held-out test set:

```python
r2(vgv.predict(test_gdl), test_gdl.sample_table.phenotype)
# 0.167938
```

In this case, the prediction R^2 is actually marginally lower than standard VIPRS model, which can happen in some 
cases, as illustrated in the simulation results in our manuscript. As our results showed, the main advantage of 
the `GridSearch` module will be when applied on real phenotypes or when there are some mismatches between 
the LD reference panel and the GWAS summary statistics.

## Commandline scripts

If you are not comfortable programming in `python` and would like to access some of the functionalities 
of `viprs` with minimal interaction with `python` code, we packaged a number of commandline 
scripts that can be useful for some downstream applications.

The binaries that are currently supported are:

1) `viprs_fit`: For performing model fit and estimating the posterior for the effect sizes.
2) `viprs_score`: For generating polygenic scores for new test samples.
3) `viprs_evaluate`: For evaluating the predictive performance of PRS methods.

Once you install `viprs` via `pip`, these scripts will be added to the system `PATH` 
and you can invoke them directly from the commandline, as follows:

```shell
$ viprs_fit -h

## Download LD matrices

To run the `viprs` software, you may need access to pre-computed LD matrices. Here, we provide access to pre-computed LD matrices
from the UK Biobank (UKB) dataset:

- LD matrices derived from the "White British" cohort (N=50,000) in the UKB: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.7036625.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7036625)


You can also use the `data_utils` module from the `viprs` package to download those 
data sources. For example, to download the UKB LD matrices listed above, you can do 
the following:

```python
import viprs as vp

# Download all matrices from Zenodo:
vp.download_ukb_wb_ld_matrix('data/ld/')

# Download LD matrices for chromosomes 21 and 22:
vp.download_ukb_wb_ld_matrix('data/ld/', chromosome=[21, 22])

```

This will download the LD matrix to a sub-folder in the working directory called `data/ld`. We will add more utilities 
like this in the future to streamline PRS model training and testing.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

- **How do I create my own LD matrices and store them in formats compatible with `viprs`?**

You can use the software package [magenpy](https://github.com/shz9/magenpy) to compute LD matrices 
from any reference genotype dataset. `magenpy` provides interfaces for computing LD matrices 
using 3 commonly used LD estimators: `shrinkage`, `windowed` (or banded), and `block
`-based LD matrices. Check the relevant documentation [here](https://github.com/shz9/magenpy#3-calculating-ld-matrices).
