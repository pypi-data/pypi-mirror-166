CloudLink Server

CloudLink is a free and open-source, websocket-powered API optimized for Scratch 3.0.
For documentation, please visit https://hackmd.io/g6BogABhT6ux1GA2oqaOXA

Server based on https://github.com/Pithikos/python-websocket-server
The WebsocketServer that is bundled with CloudLink is modified to support Cloudflared and fixes an issue with asserting the HTTP websocket upgrade request.

Please see https://github.com/MikeDev101/cloudlink for more details.

        To define a custom command, a command must contain the following parameters:
        self, client, server, message, listener_detected, listener_id, room_id

        self - Should be a class reference to itself.
        client - Dictionary object that identifies clients. Contains headers, address, handler, and id. See /cloudlink/websocket_server/websocket_server.py for info.
        server - Required for the websocket server and for backward compatibility.
        listener_detected - Boolean that is set when Cloudlink.server.serverRootHandlers checks a packet and identifies the JSON key "listener" in a packet.
        listener_id - Any value that is set when Cloudlink.server.serverRootHandlers checks a packet and reads the JSON key "listener" in a packet.
        room_id - Array of strings that is set when a client has been linked to rooms. Defaults to either None or ["default"].

        Most of the time, you will be passing listener_detected, listener_id, and room_id to various cloudlink functions. You will likely never use server.
