# self-driving-lab-demo (WIP)

> Software and instructions for setting up and running an autonomous (self-driving) laboratory optics demo using dimmable RGB LEDs, a 10-channel spectrophotometer, a microcontroller, and an adaptive design algorithm.

Self-driving labs are the future; however, the capital and expertise required can be daunting. We introduce the idea of a constrained, high-dimensional, multi-objective optimization task for less than $100, a square foot of desk space, and an hour of total setup time from the shopping cart to the first "autonomous drive." We use optics rather than chemistry for our demo; after all, light is easier to move than matter. While not strictly materials-based, importantly, several core principles of a self-driving materials discovery lab are retained in this cross-domain example: sending commands to hardware to adjust physical parameters, receiving measured objective properties, decision-making via active learning, and utilizing cloud-based simulations. The demo is accessible, extensible, modular, and repeatable, making it an ideal candidate for both low-cost experimental adaptive design prototyping and learning the principles of self-driving laboratories in a low-risk setting.

Most of the build instructions will go into the Hackaday project page, probably with periodic updates to GitHub. GitHub will host the software that I develop.

The BOM uses Raspberry Pi (RPi) in favor of Arduino to support running complex adaptive
design algorithms locally using the higher-end RPi models such as 4B with 8 GB RAM. RPi
is a standalone computer, whereas Arduino is a microcontroller.

Additionally, due to the chip shortage, the current setup (2022-08-16) is designed for
RPi Pico W (see https://github.com/sparks-baird/self-driving-lab-demo/issues/8), but can be adapted to other models.

## ToDo:

- [x] order parts for initial prototype
- [x] assemble hardware
- [x] [set up RPi](https://learn.adafruit.com/raspberry-pi-zero-creation/overview)
- [x] [simple Blinkt! test](https://learn.pimoroni.com/article/getting-started-with-blinkt)
- [x] [simple 10-channel sensor test](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_AS7341)
- [x] [simple Blinkt! + 10-channel sensor test](https://github.com/sparks-baird/self-driving-lab-demo/blob/main/scripts/blinkt_as7341_basic.py)
- [x] fixture to mount sensor perpendicular to LED Blinkt!
- [ ] write unit tests for Blinkt! and 10-channel sensor
- [ ] write script/library to integrate components
- [x] "first drive" using random search

## Installation

In order to set up the necessary environment:

1. review and uncomment what you need in `environment.yml` and create an environment `self-driving-lab-demo` with the help of [conda]:
   ```
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```
2. activate the new environment with:
   ```
   conda activate self-driving-lab-demo
   ```

> **_NOTE:_**  The conda environment will have self-driving-lab-demo installed in editable mode.
> Some changes, e.g. in `setup.cfg`, might require you to run `pip install -e .` again.


Optional and needed only once after `git clone`:

3. install several [pre-commit] git hooks with:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   # You might also want to run `pre-commit autoupdate`
   ```
   and checkout the configuration under `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
   The `-n, --no-verify` flag of `git commit` can be used to deactivate pre-commit hooks temporarily.

4. install [nbstripout] git hooks to remove the output cells of committed notebooks with:
   ```bash
   nbstripout --install --attributes notebooks/.gitattributes
   ```
   This is useful to avoid large diffs due to plots in your notebooks.
   A simple `nbstripout --uninstall` will revert these changes.


Then take a look into the `scripts` and `notebooks` folders.

## Dependency Management & Reproducibility

1. Always keep your abstract (unpinned) dependencies updated in `environment.yml` and eventually
   in `setup.cfg` if you want to ship and install your package via `pip` later on.
2. Create concrete dependencies as `environment.lock.yml` for the exact reproduction of your
   environment with:
   ```bash
   conda env export -n self-driving-lab-demo -f environment.lock.yml
   ```
   For multi-OS development, consider using `--no-builds` during the export.
3. Update your current environment with respect to a new `environment.lock.yml` using:
   ```bash
   conda env update -f environment.lock.yml --prune
   ```
