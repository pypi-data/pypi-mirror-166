# tokyo.py
Python library for interacting with Tokyo API (https://api.miduwu.ga/)

## Installation
`pip install tokyo.py`

## Usage
```py
import tokyo
import asyncio
from tokyo.properties import Api

api = Api()
print(api.endpoints)

async def main():
    json = await tokyo.Json.get(endpoint = ..., builders = {
    ...
    })
    bytes = await tokyo.Buffer.get(endpoint = ..., builders = {
    ...
    })
    anime = await tokyo.Anime.get(endpoint = ..., builders = [
    ...
    ])
    print(json, bytes, anime)

    # Parameter "endpoint" is the request endpoint string.
    # Parameter "builders" is the request parameters/route. {} for parameters, [] for route.
    # await tokyo.Json.get(endpoint = '8ball', builders = {'text': 'Hi'})
    # await tokyo.Anime.get(endpoint = 'gifs', builders = ['angry'])

asyncio.run(main())
```
