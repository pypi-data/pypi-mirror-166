## Introduction
getbalance is a Python library that provides a wallet address balance at any day.
It was born from the tedious task of manually adding/subracting values to get the balance of an address at any given day.
All kudos to the Ethereum team of developers for the free APIs.

## Security
By default getbalance does not guard against quadratic blowup or billion laughs xml attacks. To guard against these install defusedxml.
