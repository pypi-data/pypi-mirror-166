Contained here are some helpful RDKit utilities for:

* generating conformers
    * ranking by MMFF electrostatic energy (for ELF conformer selection)
    * selecting to maximize diversity via RMS (for ELF conformer selection)
* finding symmetric atoms in a molecule
* finding the shell of neighbors around a central fragment, N bonds away


There are also convenience functions for:

* loading molecules from any input `MolFromInput`
* loading molecules from SMILES with keyword arguments for `removeHs`, etc.
* loading molecules and reordering by atom map number, analogous to the OpenFF toolkit `Molecule.from_mapped_smiles`
* generally reordering conformers
* optimizing molecules by specifying force field using a string name


Functions are in files such as `rdchem`, `rdDistGeom`, etc. to try to keep to
RDKit's organisation convention. Similarly to RDKit, a `Chem` and `AllChem`
are provided with group imports.
Functions are written in PascalCase and keyword arguments in camelCase, also to
keep to RDKit convention.
