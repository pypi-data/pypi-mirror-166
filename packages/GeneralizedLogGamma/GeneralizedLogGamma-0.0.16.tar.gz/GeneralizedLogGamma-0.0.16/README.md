# GeneralizedLogGamma

Set of tools to fit generalized gamma (GG) and generalized log-gamma distribution (GLG). Some developed functions are:

* Density function of a generalized log-gamma distribution.
* Cumulative distribution function of a generalized log-gamma distribution.
* Quantile function of a generalized log-gamma distribution.
* Generate random values of a generalized log-gamma distribution.
* Entropy function of a generalized log-gamma distribution.
* Survival function of generalized gamma distribution.
* Hazard function of a generalized gamma distribution.
* Generate random values of K-th Order Statistics from a generalized log-gamma distribution.
* Log-likelihood of generalized log-gamma distribution
* Mean, median, mode, variance, coeficient of variation, skewness, kurtosis of generalized log-gamma distribution.
