Tool to analyse images of cleared and trypan blue stained leaves to assess leaf damage.

limu_original.py is the program used for the original publication.

limu.py is updated to be somewhat flexible with project parameters outside the script itself. It might need tweaking to suit your project though.

Currently only works with Canon .cr2 raw images. If you have other types please let me know and I might add other formats.

    usage: limu [-h] [-p PROJECT] [-i INDIR] [-v] [-r]
