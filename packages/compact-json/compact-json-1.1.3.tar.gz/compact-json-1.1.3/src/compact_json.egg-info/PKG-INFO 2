# compact-json

This package is in the early stages of development. It might work for you and it could quite easily throw runtime exceptions due to the large
number of latent bugs. You are welcome to raise issues.

## Credits

`compact-json` is primarily a Python port of [FracturedJsonJs](https://github.com/j-brooke/FracturedJsonJs) by [j-brooke](https://github.com/j-brooke). FractureJson is also
an excellent [Visual Studio Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=j-brooke.fracturedjsonvsc). This package has no other relationship
with this original code, and hence all the bugs are my own.
