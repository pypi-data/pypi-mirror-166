# Matrices-Py

A basic set of utilities for storing and manipulating data in â‰¤ 2 dimensions.

This library aims to be a "natural" extension to the core Python tool set - similar to the [`fractions`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fractions.html) module of the standard library, but centered around matrices. Everything contained within this library is, and will always be, written in Python alone.

The intent, here, is **not** to provide a substitute for [NumPy](https://numpy.org/). While there may be similarities in certain parts of the API, NumPy should always be the choice for efficient data storage and vectorization in larger applications - especially in more than two dimensions. The tools provided in this library aim towards smaller applications that wish to manipulate objects in two dimensions, without much concern for speed.

## Getting Started

This project is available through [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) (requires Python 3.10 or higher):

```
pip install matrices-py
```

Documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/braedynl/matrices-py/wiki) (under the Wiki tab, the guide is recommended). [Examples and recipes](https://github.com/braedynl/matrices-py/wiki/Examples-and-Recipes) can be found there as well.

**Note that this library is in its infancy, and may see future changes that are not always backwards compatible.**
