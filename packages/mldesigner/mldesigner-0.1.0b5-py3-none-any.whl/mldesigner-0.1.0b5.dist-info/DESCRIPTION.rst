# Azure Machine Learning Designer Python SDK

The `mldesigner` package provide the SDK interface which work along with Azure ML Designer (drag-n-drop ML) UI experience.

- [Azure ML Designer (drag-n-drop ML)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-designer): designer is a UI tool in the Azure ML workspace for visually connecting datasets and components on an interactive canvas to create machine learning pipelines. To learn how to get started with the designer, see [Tutorial: Predict automobile price with the designer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/tutorial-designer-automobile-price-train-score).


Especially, the package ease the authoring experience of resources like `Components` & `Pipelines`:

- [Components](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-component): self-contained piece of code that does one step in a machine learning pipeline: data preprocessing, model training, model scoring, a hyperparameter tuning run, etc. Such that it can be parameterized and then used in different contexts.
- [Pipelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-ml-pipelines): independently executable workflow of machine learning tasks composed by Components.
