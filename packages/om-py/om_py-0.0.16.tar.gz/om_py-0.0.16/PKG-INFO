Description: # OM-py 
        
        With this package I aim to translate to Python some of the functions of OpenMusic.
        
        ##### Functions implemented
        
        _om_scale, f2mc_. 
        
        ### Observations
        
        * In Python, we can not use `->` in the functions name, so I changed `->` to `2`. Then `f->mc` become `f2mc`. 
        * In Python, we can not use `-` in the functions name, so I changed `-` to `_`. Then `om-scale` become `om_scale`.
        
        `pip install om_py`.
