# OM-py 

With this package I aim to translate to Python some of the functions of OpenMusic.

##### Functions implemented

_om_scale, f2mc_. 

### Observations

* In Python, we can not use `->` in the functions name, so I changed `->` to `2`. Then `f->mc` become `f2mc`. 
* In Python, we can not use `-` in the functions name, so I changed `-` to `_`. Then `om-scale` become `om_scale`.

`pip install om_py`.
