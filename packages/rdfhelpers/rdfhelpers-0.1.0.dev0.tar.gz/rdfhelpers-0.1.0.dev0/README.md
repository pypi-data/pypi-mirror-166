# RDF Helpers

Useful stuff when programming with RDFLib:
- Various ways to manipulate RDF graphs (shortcuts, really)
- Predefined graph transformation (e.g., containers --> repeated properties)
- Templated queries
- Templated graph cretation (based on SPARQL `CONSTRUCT`)
- Journaled graphs
- etc.

## To Do:
- More test coverage
- More predefined transformations (e.g., flat descriptions --> hierarchical descriptions)
- Code refactoring between this and `xmptools` (move stuff from the latter to the former)
- Documentation
