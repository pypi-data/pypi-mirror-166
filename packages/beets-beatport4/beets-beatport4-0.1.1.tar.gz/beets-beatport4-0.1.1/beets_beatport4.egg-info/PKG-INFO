Plugin for `beets <https://github.com/beetbox/beets>`_ to replace stock beatport plugin and use Beatport API v4 as an
autotagger source.

As Beatport had killed their API v3, the stock beatport plugin does not work anymore. It is also currently not possible to request the access to the API "normal" way, so I have found workaround and updated the code to use the new specification.

For more info, see the discussion on this issue: https://github.com/beetbox/beets/issues/3862

I have also opened a pull request in the official beets repository (https://github.com/beetbox/beets/pull/4477), so if it gets merged, I am probably going to take down this plugin.

Installation
------------

Install this plugin with

..

   $ pip install beets-beatport4

and add ``beatport4`` to the ``plugins`` list in your beets config file.

Beatport Authorization (workaround)
-----------------------------------
1. Add ``beatport4`` plugin to your ``beets/config.yaml`` plugins list
2. When the first import with plugin enabled happens, you will be prompted to paste the access token JSON
3. Visit https://api.beatport.com/v4/docs/
4. Open Network tab in your browser and start capturing the traffic
5. Login with your Beatport account
6. Search for the following request: ``https://api.beatport.com/v4/auth/o/token/?code=...``
7. Copy the response (whole JSON structure)
8. Paste it to the terminal (or `beatport_token.json` file next to your ``beets/config.yaml`` - you can check the path by running ``beet config --paths`` command)
9. You should see ``Beatport authorized as USER <email>`` message
10. If the token expires, you will be prompted again and required to repeat above steps

Configuration and Usage
-----------------------
Apart from the authorization part, plugin should work exactly the same way as the stock one, so please refer to the `official documentation <https://beets.readthedocs.io/en/v1.6.0/plugins/index.html#metadata-source-plugin-configuration>`_
