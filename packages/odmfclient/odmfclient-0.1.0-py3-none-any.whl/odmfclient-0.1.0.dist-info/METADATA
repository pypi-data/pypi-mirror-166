# API client for ODMF

This package allows programatic access to [ODMF](https://github.com/jlu-ilr-hydro/odmf) databases with Python. 
It is based on [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/). Data analyses in R use [the httr module](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/vignettes/quickstart.html) 

## Installation
