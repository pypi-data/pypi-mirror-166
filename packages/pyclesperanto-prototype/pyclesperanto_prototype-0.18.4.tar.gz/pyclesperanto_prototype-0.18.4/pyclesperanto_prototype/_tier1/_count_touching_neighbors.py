def count_touching_neighbors(touch_matrix: Image, touching_neighbors_count_destination: Image = None) -> Image:
    """Takes a touch matrix as input and delivers a vector with number of 
    touching neighbors per label as a vector.

    Note: Background is considered as something that can touch.
    To ignore touches with background, hand over a touch matrix where the
    first column (index = 0) has been set to 0. Use set_column for that.
