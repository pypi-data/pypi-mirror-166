    'long_description': '# A sad IPHone story ...\nI wrote this python script after my iPhone had a unrepairable hardware failure and a corrupt iTunes backup that could not be restored on my new iPhone!\nI was losing pictures but not that much as I regularly extracts them, but it was a totally different story for the contacts, as iTunes offers no way to extract them and I refuse to send my data to iCloud.\nI search for a way to recover my contacts and I found not only many applications that all promise that they will repair and/ore recover you data, but also simple script that extract them from the database of the address book. You just need a backup from iTunes. \nSo I decided to write my own version that extracts all the fields I need in a vCard 3.0 format. I do not intend to cover all the cases but i think it is already quite complete, and I hope it will help others. \nI took this opportunity to write it in python, language that I barely know, so i ask for mercy to the experts in Python because I probably do not follow theirs best practice :)\n\n# Install\n## prerequisits\n- python >=3.9 [prerequisits]([https://www.python.org/downloads/])\n- pip\n- pipx (optional)\n## Intall \n```\n    pip install itunescontactsexport\n```\nor\n```\n    pip install pipx\n    pipx install itunescontactsexport\n```\n \n# Usage\n There 2 modes to use this script:\n - iTunes mode: You need to have access to the directory of a iTunes backup of your phone.
