By changing some of the options, you can export to a traditional editor like Premiere Pro and adjust the edits there, adjust the pacing of the cuts, and change the method of editing like using audio loudness and video motion to judge making cuts.\n\nRun:\n    auto-editor --help\n\nTo get the list of options.",

Speeds 0 or below and 99999 or above will be cut completely.\n Start\n - When the speed first gets applied. The default unit is in frames, but second units can also be used.\n End\n - When the speed stops being applied. It can use both frame and second units.",
