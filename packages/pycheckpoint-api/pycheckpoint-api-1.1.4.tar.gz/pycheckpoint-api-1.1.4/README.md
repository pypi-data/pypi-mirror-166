pyCheckpoint-API is an SDK that provides a uniform and easy-to-use interface for each of the Checkpoint Firewall product API versions.

This SDK is not affiliated with, nor supported by Checkpoint in any way.

## Overview
Checkpoint firewalls solution are now using a well detailed API. This SDK simplifies software development using the Checkpoint Firewall API in Python.

This SDK is based on the [Checkpoint official API documentation](https://sc1.checkpoint.com/documents/latest/APIs/#introduction~v1.8%20).

This SDK leverages the [RESTfly framework](https://restfly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) developed by Steve McGrath.

This SDK implementation was largely inspired from the [pyZscaler](https://github.com/mitchos/pyZscaler) SDK development.

## Features
-  Simplified authentication with Checkpoint API versions.
-  Uniform interaction with the Checkpoint API versions.
-  Uses [python-box](https://github.com/cdgriffith/Box/wiki) to add dot notation access to json data structures.
-  Various quality of life enhancements for object CRUD methods.

## Products
-  [Checkpoint](https://www.checkpoint.com/) Firewall

## Installation

The most recent version can be installed from pypi as per below.

   $ pip install pycheckpoint-api

## Usage

Before you can interact with the Checkpoint API, you may need to generate API keys directly in the management interface or use a classic username/password at each connection.

Once you have the requirements and you have installed pyCheckpoint-API, you're ready to go.

### Quick Examples

#### API login/logout
```python
   from pycheckpoint_api.management import Management
   from pprint import pprint

   # Please note that, as it's an example, we enabled the SSL verify to False to avoid having SSL certificate issues.
   # However, it's highly recommanded to use certificates with know certificate authorities.
   # If you want to use an API key instead, remove the 'user' and 'password' fields and use the 'api_key' field.
   with Management(
      hostname='HOSTNAME',
      port='PORT',
      user='USER',
      password='PASSWORD',
      version='VERSION',
      domain='DOMAIN',
      ssl_verify=False,
   ) as api:

      pprint(
        "Connection is successfull, we have a token: "
        + api._session.headers["X-chkp-sid"]
      )

   # Since we are out of the previous block, the API has been disconnected
   pprint("Logout is successfull")
```

### User Documentation
TODO

## Is It Tested?
Yes! pyCheckpoint-API has a complete test suite that fully covers all implemented methods

## Contributing

Contributions to pyCheckpoint-API are absolutely welcome.

Please see the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/LetMeR00t/pyCheckpoint-API/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.

[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) is currently being used for builds and management. You'll want to have poetry installed and available in your environment.

Once Poetry is installed, you can create and validate your development environment using those commands:

```sh
poetry install
# this is installing the package using poetry

poetry build
# this is building the package locally (not required)
   
poetry shell
# this is usind the dedicated virtual environment for development
   
pytest
# Run the tests
```

You should then see the output of pytest results with all tests passed.
