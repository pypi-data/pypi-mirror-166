        Retrieve all objects.

        Args:
            filter_results (str, optional): Search expression to filter objects by.\
            The provided text should be exactly the same as it would be given in SmartConsole Object Explorer.\
            The logical operators in the expression ('AND', 'OR') should be provided in capital letters.\
            he search involves both a IP search and a textual search in name, comment, tags etc.
            limit (int, optional): The maximal number of returned results. Defaults to 50 (between 1 and 500)
            offset (int, optional): Number of the results to initially skip. Defaults to 0
            order (List[dict], optional): Sorts results by the given field. By default the results are sorted in the \
            descending order by the session publish time.
            show_as_ranges (bool, optional): When true, the group's matched content is displayed as ranges of IP addresses \
            rather than network objects. Objects that are not represented using IP addresses are presented as objects.\
            The 'members' parameter is omitted from the response and instead the 'ranges' parameter is displayed.\
            Defaults to False.

        Keyword Args:
            **details_level (str, optional):
                The level of detail for some of the fields in the response can vary from showing only the UID value\
                of the object to a fully detailed representation of the object.
            **domains_to_process (List[str], optional):
                Indicates which domains to process the commands on. It cannot be used with the details_level full,\
                must be run from the System Domain only and with ignore_warnings true.\
                Valid values are: CURRENT_DOMAIN, ALL_DOMAINS_ON_THIS_SERVER.

        Returns:
            :obj:`Box`: The response from the server
