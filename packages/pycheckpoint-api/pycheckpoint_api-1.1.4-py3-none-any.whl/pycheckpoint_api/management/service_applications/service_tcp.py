        Create new object.

        Args:
            name (str): Object name. Must be unique in the domain.
            aggressive_aging (dict, optional): Sets short (aggressive) timeouts for idle connections.
            keep_connections_open_after_policy_installation (bool, optional): Keep connections open after policy has been \
            installed even if they are not allowed under the new policy. This overrides the settings in the Connection \
            Persistence page. If you change this property, the change will not affect open connections, but only \
            future connections.
            match_by_protocol_signature (bool, optional): A value of true enables matching by the selected protocol's \
            signature - the signature identifies the protocol as genuine. Select this option to limit the port to \
            the specified protocol.\ If the selected protocol does not support matching by signature, this field \
            cannot be set to true.
            match_for_any (bool, optional): Indicates whether this service is used when 'Any' is set as the rule's service \
            and there are several service objects with the same source port and protocol.
            override_default_settings (bool, optional): Indicates whether this service is a Data Domain service which \
            has been overridden
            port (str, optional): The number of the port used to provide this service.\
            To specify a port range, place a hyphen between the lowest and highest port numbers, for example 44-55.
            protocol (str, optional): Select the protocol type associated with the service, and by implication, the \
            management server (if any) that enforces Content Security and Authentication for the service.\
            Selecting a Protocol Type invokes the specific protocol handlers for each protocol type,\
            thus enabling higher level of security by parsing the protocol, and higher level of connectivity\
            by tracking dynamic actions (such as opening of ports).
            session_timeout (int, optional): Time (in seconds) before the session times out.
            source_port (str, optional): Port number for the client side service. If specified, only those Source port \
            Numbers will be Accepted, Dropped, or Rejected during packet inspection. Otherwise, the source port is \
            not inspected.
            sync_connections_on_cluster (bool, optional): Enables state-synchronized High Availability or Load Sharing \
            on a ClusterXL or OPSEC-certified cluster.
            tags (Union(str,List[str]), optional): Collection of tag identifiers.
            use_default_session_timeout (bool, optional): Use default virtual session timeout.

        Keyword Args:
            **set_if_exists (bool, optional):

                The command behaviour will be the same as if originally a set command was called.
                Pay attention that original object's fields will be overwritten by the fields provided in the request payload!
            **color (Color, optional):
                Color of the object. Should be one of existing colors.
            **comments (str, optional):
                Comments string.
            **details_level (str, optional):
                The level of detail for some of the fields in the response can vary from showing only the UID value\
                of the object to a fully detailed representation of the object.
            **groups (Union(str,List[str]), optional):
                Collection of group identifiers.
            **ignore_warnings (bool, optional):
