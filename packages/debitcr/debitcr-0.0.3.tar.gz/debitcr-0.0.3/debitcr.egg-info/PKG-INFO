## Introduction
debitcr is a Python library that provides detailed wallet history and categorizes transactions as sent/received.
It was born from the need of organizing institutional-volume level of transactions.
All kudos to the Ethereum team of developers for the free APIs.

## Security
By default debitcr does not guard against quadratic blowup or billion laughs xml attacks. To guard against these install defusedxml.
