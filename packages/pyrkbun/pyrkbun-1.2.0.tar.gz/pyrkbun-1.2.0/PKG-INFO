           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

# Getting Started
## Installation
Install pyrkbun using pip.

```
pip install pyrkbun
```
## Enable porkbun.com API access
You will need to ensure that you have API access enabled for your domain and an API Access Key / Secret Key. Details on how to configure your domain for API access can be found on the [porkbun website](https://kb.porkbun.com/article/190-getting-started-with-the-porkbun-api)

## Configure Environment
Before using pyrkbun you will need to set a couple of envorinment variables to hold your API credentails.
```
export PYRK_API_SECRET_KEY='sk_abcdef123456789abcdef123456789abcdef'
export PYRK_API_KEY = 'sk_abcdef123456789abcdef123456789abcdef'
```
By default pyrkbun will utilise the default porkbun.com API endpoint which supports both IPv4 and IPv6. To force IPv4 only you can set an additional environement variable as follows.
```
export PYRK_FORCE_V4=True
```
If you are on a low latency path to the Porkbun service you may hit API rate limits and get 503 returned from the API resulting in ApiFailure exception being raised. You can set a rate limit environment variable to automatically add a delay in seconds before each API call. If this variable is not set no dealy will be addded.
```
export PYRK_RATE=1.5
```
# Using pyrkbun in your python project
pyrkbun exposes all of the porkbun.com api functionality through a set of functions and classes. Functionality is grouped into sub-modules as follows:
 - **pyrkbun.ssl:** Operations related to certificate management.  Exposes a single function to reirieve certifcate bundle.
 - **pyrkbun.pricing:** Operations relating to retrival of domain pricing information. Exposes a single function to retrieve pricing information.
 - **pyrkbun.dns:** Operations relating to DNS management. This is the bulk of the functionality.

## pyrkbun ssl
Retrieve porkbun.com provided wildcard cert bundle for your domain.
 ```python
>>> import pyrkbun
>>> x = pyrkbun.ssl.get()
>>> print(x)
{'status': 'SUCCESS',
'intermediatecertificate': '<cert-data>',
'certificatechain': '<cert-data>',
'privatekey': "<cert-data>",
'publickey': '<cert-data>'}

 ```
## pyrkbun pricing
Retrieve porkbun.com default domain pricing data.
 ```python
>>> import pyrkbun
>>> x = pyrkbun.pricing.get()
>>> print(x)
{'status': 'SUCCESS',
'pricing': {'de': {'registration': '5.55', 'renewal': '4.11',
'transfer': '4.11', 'coupons': {'registration':
{'code': 'AWESOMENESS', 'max_per_user': 1, 'first_year_only': 'yes',
'type': 'amount', 'amount': 1}}},
'xof': {'registration': '6.49', 'renewal': '21.94', ... }
```
## pyrkbun dns
DNS comprises the bulk of the functionality of pyrkbun. The dns submodule defines a class for interacting with the DNS api. You can either instantiate class instances and use the exposed instance methods, or execute class methods to interact with the API without the need to instantiate a class instance.

NOTE: When defining hostnames for A, AAAA, CNAME and ALIAS records, you should always provide the unqualified name. (e.g. if your domain is example.com, provide hostnames as 'www' not 'www.example.com').

### dns class instantiation
The following example shows how to instantiate a class instance and create, update and delete a DNS record.
 ```python
>>> import pyrkbun

# Instantiate class instance representing 'www' A record with IP of '198.51.100.45' and ttl of 620 in domain example.com
>>> x = pyrkbun.dns('example.com',
                    'A',
                    '198.51.100.45',
                    'www',
                    '620',
                    '0') 

# Call porkbun API to create DNS record from class data
>>> x.create() 
{'status': 'SUCCESS', 'id': 253916852}

# Update hostname
>>> x.name = 'website' 

# Call porkbun API to update DNS record with new hostname
>>> x.update()
{'status': 'SUCCESS'}

# Refresh record data held in class instance (in case updates were made out of band)
>>> x.refresh()
{'status': 'SUCCESS'}

# Delete the record
>>> x.delete()
{'status': 'SUCCESS'}
```

### dns class methods
The following example shows how to create, update and delete a DNS record using the provided class methods.
 ```python
>>> import pyrkbun

# Create dict containd data for a 'www' A record with IP of '198.51.100.45' and ttl of 620 in domain example.com
>>> record = {'name': 'www',
            'type': 'A',
            'content': '198.51.100.45',
            'ttl': '620',
            'prio': '0'}

# Call porkbun API to create record
>>> x = pyrkbun.dns.create_record('example.com', record)
>>> print(x)
{'status': 'SUCCESS', 'id': 253475380}

# Create record containing updates
>>> update = {'name': 'website',
            'type': 'A',
            'content': '198.51.100.45',
            'ttl': '620',
            'prio': '0'}

# Call porkbun API to update DNS record
>>> x = pyrkbun.dns.update_record('example.com', update)
>>> print(x)
{'status': 'SUCCESS'}

# Delete the record by name and type
>>> x = pyrkbun.dns.delete_record('example.com', 'A', 'www')
>>> print(x)
{'status': 'SUCCESS'}
```

A class method is exposed to collect existing domain records. The method will return a list of class instances for each record returned. Arguments can be provided to the method to select specific records or set of records to be returned. To collect all records for a domain simply provide the domain name as the only argument.
```python
>>> import pyrkbun

>>> x = pyrkbun.dns.get_records('example.com')
>>> print(x)
[Dns(domain='example.com', name='www', record_type='A',
content='198.51.100.45', ttl='650', prio='0', notes='',
record_id='253440859'), Dns(domain='example.com', .... ]
```

### Getting help on working with dns
All methods and functions are fully documented, additional detail on working with pyrkbun is available via the python help function.
```python
>>> import pyrkbun

>>> help(pyrkbun.dns)
...
```

## pyrkbun ping
Porkbun provides a simple API endpoint for polling the API and returning your current IP address. This can be useful for usecases such as dynamic dns record creation. This is exposed in pyrkbun as ***pyrkbun.ping***
```python
>>> import pyrkbun

# Ping porkbun API and return IP
>>> x = pyrkbun.ping()
>>> print(x)
{'status': 'SUCCESS', 'yourIp': '2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334'}

# Ping porkbun API and force the use of IPv4
>>> x = pyrkbun.ping(ipv4=True)
>>> print(x)
{'status': 'SUCCESS', 'yourIp': '198.51.100.45'}
```

# Using pyrkbun CLI from the terminal (BETA)
You can utilise the functionality of pyrkbun directly from the terminal without the need to write your own python code.

The cli interface is availble using the command `pyrkbun`

Help is available from the command line
```
% pyrkbun -h
usage: cli.py [-h] {ping,pricing,ssl,dns} ...

CLI interface to the pyrkbun python library.
        
Set environment variables for API Key and API Secret Key to authenticate commands.

For API Key set:

### bulk operations
Perfrom bulk operations on domain records by provding a json file containg record data. The command requires an input json file, output file (to write operation results) and mode.

The following modes are supported:

**add**: Add all records in the provided file.  
**flush**: Delete ALL existing records and load records from provided file.  
**merge (default)**: Update existing records and add new records if they do not yet exist. Records not specified in the file will remain unchanged and no records will be deleted. Existing records to be updated MUST include the record ID.

Example usage:
```
% pyrkbun dns example.com bulk ./records.json ./result.json -mode merge
```

Example input file:
```json
[
// Existing record to be updated - note inclusion of ID
// Record id's are only required when using the 'merge' mode and only for existing records to be updated with new data
    {
        "content": "198.51.100.46",
        "name": "www",
        "ttl": "600",
        "prio": "0",
        "notes": "Company Website",
        "type": "A",
        "id": "256365177"
    },
// New record to be created - id field is not required
// When using the 'flush' or 'add' modes record id's are never required
    {
        "content": "mail.example.com",
        "name": "",
        "ttl": "600",
        "prio": "10",
