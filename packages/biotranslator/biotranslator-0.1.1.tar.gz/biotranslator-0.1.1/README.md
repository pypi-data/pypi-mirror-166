# BioTranslator API

BioTranslator is a cross-modal translator which can annotate biology instances only using user-written texts.
The codes here can reproduce the main results in BioTranslator paper, including zero-shot protein function prediction, zero-shot cell type prediction, and predict the nodes and edges of a gene pathway.
BioTranslator takes a user-written textual description of the new discovery and then translates this description to a non-text biological data instance. Our tool frees scientists from limiting their analysis within predefined controlled vocabularies, thus accelerating new biomedical discoveries.
