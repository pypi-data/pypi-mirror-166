# ReCPP

C Preprocessor for Reverse Engineering

This is a fork of pcpp, the Python-based C preprocessor, with modifications to help with reverse engineering.

I may expand & rewrite some preprocessing logic in the future, but at the moment, I just have a change hard-coded that helps me solve a particular problem.
