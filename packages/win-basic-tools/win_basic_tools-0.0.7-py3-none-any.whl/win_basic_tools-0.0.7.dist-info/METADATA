# win-basic-tools


## Before installing...
I know there are better and older options for making programs to run in Windows Command Processor. If you seek those try GNU for Windows.
But if you are a Python enthusiast you can modify this at your will.

Description:
This repository intends to give some simple commands to Windows cmd.exe.

## Installation

It is intended for the global Python Env.
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stablw/) to install win-basic-tools

~~~bash
$ pip install win-basic-tools
~~~

## Usage

### Windows

~~~bash
$ win-basic-tools setup
~~~

Run for setting the macros file for your cmd.exe. It will create the `.macros.doskey` at your home directory and add it to the Registry.
This will create the alias to the `win_basic_tools/sources/` resources and to some of the CLI commands present on Windows as the most commom Unix commands. Especially useful for WSL users that need an single command syntax between systems.
Alias gives more source control than entry-points, however maybe it will be the choice in the future.

After refreshing your prompt, you can use `ls`, `ll`, `which`, `grep`. See `$HOME/.macros.doskey` for the list of aliases.

Uninstall: run `win-basic-tools uninstall` before `pip uninstall` for reseting Registry


### Others

Although this package is mainly intended for Windows, the resources in `win_basic_tools/sources` can be used in any system that runs Python3.6+
