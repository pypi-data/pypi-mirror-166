Quick Examples
--------------

Here's a quick little example of the library being used to make a simple, text-based Akinator game:

.. code-block:: python

    import akinator
    import asyncio

    aki = akinator.AsyncAkinator()

    async def main():
        q = await aki.start()

        while aki.progression <= 80:
            a = input(q + "\n\t")
            if a == "b":
                try:
                    q = await aki.back()
                except akinator.CantGoBackAnyFurther:
                    pass
            else:
                q = await aki.answer(a)
        await aki.win()

        correct = input(f"It's {aki.first_guess['name']} ({aki.first_guess['description']})! Was I correct?\n{aki.first_guess['absolute_picture_path']}\n\t")
        if correct.lower() == "yes" or correct.lower() == "y":
            print("Yay\n")
        else:
            print("Oof\n")
        await aki.close()

    await asyncio.run(main())
