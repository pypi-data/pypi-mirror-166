"""
Writer for sending stream of python objects over a ZMQ socket.

The intended usage is that you construct a ZmqStreamReader in one process
and a ZmqStreamWriter (with the same port number as the reader) in a worker
process. The worker process can then use the stream to send its result to the
reader.
